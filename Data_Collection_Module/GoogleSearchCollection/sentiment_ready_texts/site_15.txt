a little bit torn between entry m4 and entry m4 pro

i have an order for the new macbook pro 14 base configuration, at 1599, and i am having a little hesitation with the base m4 pro configuration which is only 400 more at 1999.
i plan on using the macbook essentially to do what i usually do on the ipad so a lot of web browsing, light gaming such as hearthstone etc.
im pretty sure the horsepower of the base m4 is enough, but im just tempted because the m4 pro seems to be maybe an even better value.
if aaa games keep coming to mac id be glad to be able to run them, if on the move already got a fully equipped gaming rig, but thats the only use case and its very limited.
tb5 seems nice to have but again no use case of now.
you already said you have an equipped gaming rig  want to do what youre doing on the ipad so that tells me the m4 at 1,599 is gonna be just fine.
this is probably the last iteration of the design before it moves to a new thinner enclosure with a tandem oled display amongst other notable improvements.
i will agree that the 400 upgrade is a better value with the exception of slightly worse battery life only if youre looking to make upgrades to that base model
i think you'll be more than happy with the 'base' model and 400 extra in your pocket.
if you are fine with 16 gig ram then you will probably dont need a m4pro, if you have to go for 24 gig ram the pro costs just 200, that would be a no brainer for me.
for the mini the same upgrade costs 400 makes the decision more difficult.
i initially thought i would be getting base model and had settled on the 1599 price tag.
i almost hit the button on that one, but got distracted by the nano tech option.
had no clue what that was but, by the time i decided it wasnt for me, id prepared to spend the 150 extra.
yep, id been appled into being tempted by a macbook thats likely wayyy too much laptop for my needs.
i spent ages persuading myself to buy the m4 pro mac mini and ended up ordering the bottom end m4 mini.
i get student discount so this works out at 499 which is a good deal.
so it's perfect.
i have a couple of 14 m1 pro mbps one bought one inherited and one of them spends the entire time plugged into the studio display
so i don't need anything more than that.
the other one never gets used.
400  is a lot of money op, the base mbp m4 has no compromises this year with 16 gb ram, 3 tb ports and ability to use 2 external screens with lid open.
you could use that 400 saving to buy a ps5 pro or something and play elden ring on full settings.
personally i think the m4 pro base for 1,999 is the best deal in the mbp lineup.
compared to the m4 model youre getting
3x faster io with thunderbolt 5 needed if you ever want to plug into future high reshigh refresh monitors
appreciate you might not need all of these on day 1, but, in my experience with great machines like these, your hobbies tend to grow with time and you end up wanting to do more and more on it.
for an extra 400 youre getting essentially double the computer in many ways.
when you come to sell it i reckon the m4 pro will fetch a good chunk higher than the m4, so youll likely get most of that 400 back when you sell anyway.
just my 2 cents, but if you can stretch to 1,999 then thats what id do!
completely satisfied.
now my gf should get a macbook cause she is unsatisfied with her dell 7400 laptop with 14 and 161024.
now she could get mine
and i'm thinking about buying a new macbook with m4.
a new m4 macbook air would be great but is not released
yet so i need to pick a modell from the pro lineup.
in germany the m4 mbp is on sale, you get it for 1.800 euro 100 euro cheaper.
of course the mb pro with m4 pro has more power but battery life is weaker 14 hrs  2 hrs less.
compared to m3 macs the m4 is faster than m3 pro in single and similar fast in multi.
thats awesome.
when you pick the m4 pro you get 3.921  22.088 which is similar single core performance and 45 multicore perf.
so single core is still very fast with m4!
i could buy the base m4 macbook pro and my tactics would be just to order more often a new macbook, lets say every 34 yrs than 56 yrs.
saved money  could be used for bigger ssds or could be safed for next upgrade.
this is individual.
unsure now.
is there a cooling system difference one fan vs 2 etc between the m4 and m4 pro chip on the 14?
the base m3 had only one fan whereas the m3 promax models had two fans.
who knows if this has changed with m4.
