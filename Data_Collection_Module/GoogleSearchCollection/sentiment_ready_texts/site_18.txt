i am upgrading from a 2017 intel 15 mbp and am having a hard time to determine which new mbp to purchase.
the issue is that i don't think that i need the processor power of the m4pro or m4max as i am not doing crazy 4k8k video or 3d graphics.
but i like a large screen to have my work displayed without having to strain my eyes, which is why it is disappointing that apple is not offering a m4 16 model.
my normal use of my macbook pro currently is office work, spread sheet, video viewing w light editing for example, trimming clips from videos i use my iphone to take or are from zooms, screen captures, presentations, video conferences, ripping and converting dvd  bluray movies to play on my apple tv.
other tasks are light web and database design.
in the future i want to work on learning coding for the mac, as i currently work in primarily in vba on windows and have been looking into learning new coding skills and language.
i do not know if a m4 pro would really be worth the expense for the limited things that i doplan to do.
ps my history with macs have been a 17 mbp 2007 2013  2017 15 since apple discontinued the 17.
i am worried that 14 may not be large enough.
maybe take a look at the 15 macbook air?
if possible, go to the apple store or an electronics store near you that sells them so you can put hands on.
its one thing to look at pictures, but its another to actually physically see and touch it.
i too would like to see a 16 with a base m series chip.
don't need the power of a pro chip.
just a slightly bigger screen than 15 air and with promotion.
could be priced at around 400 less than the price of current 16
i did a comparison and specked out a m4 pro in both 14 and 16 inches, the difference was 300 for the larger screen
so i dont understand why apple made the arbitrary decision to not offer a m4 base chip in 16 with just a 300 price difference
in my opinion, it'd be ridiculous to put an ipad chip into the topend macbook pro.
i was surprised you're allowed to have the base m4 chip with the 14 mbp.
bite the bullet, given the m4 pro will provide you with increased longevity, and get it.
2. get a used m3 pro 16 mbp, which is now relatively cheap on ebay.
3. get a 15 macbook air, which will perform all your tasks brilliantly and is also significantly lighter.
4. wait a few months and buy the 16 refurb for 1015 off.
5. wait a few weeks for black friday and possibly buy a new 16 for upwards of 10 or so off from third party retailers.
6. wait maybe 2 months or so particularly into the holiday hangover period for retailers of janfeb for third party retailers to offer 16 for upwards of 15 off.
if in america, hop into the education store to cut the base price of 16 by 200, which gets you a good part of the way to that difference
8.
go a little radical and pick up a mac mini and a portable screen.
i see
examples of the latter for about 350 at over 17 
...
mac mini base is 499 in the edu store.
you wouldn't have the builtin battery of a laptop but if you don't really need batteryonly usage, there's a 1718 portable mac for about 8501k, assuming you already have a keyboard and mouse.
and all that should
fit in a laptoplike bag albeit, perhaps one a little thicker than typical.
there's even many portable batteries with 2 sockets to power them yes, this 'think different' frankenstein is not nearly as sleek as an allinone laptop that fits the various pieces
slim package, but you'd get the m chip you want and a
screen than even 16 while dramatically addressing the pricing gripe by about 500.
while you probably don't need the added power, the base m4pro mini  the 17 screen would come it at about the same price as the base mbpro 14 price... and if you hypothesize how much more a 16 m4 mbpro would cost, you could probably wash the 18.4 screen with an m4pro mini.
the upgraded tech guts fit in the
sized package, so if 8 becomes an actual consideration,
option requires no additional space in the bag.
in short, instead of saving about 500 but still getting your bigger screen, you might apply the 500 to the mac portion to go pro and 18.4 mobile screen.

because if you can afford the 16 version, you can also afford the m4pro cpu...
