i am considering upgrading from a 2017 ntb macbook pro to m4.
is there any information available about the cpugpu performance of the m4 versus the intel chip in the 2017 machine?
also has there been any change in the ssd and ram used in these machines since 2017?
is anyone else in the same boat considering upgrading from a 2017 model?
im also planning to upgrade from a 2017 intel macbook pro to a 14 m4 model.
i cant decide whether m4 or m4 pro is better.
i dont do anything too heavy but i plan on keeping this machine for at least 5 years.
im also torn on the standard vs nanotexture display.
im going to wait until deep dive reviews and comparisons are posted before deciding.
if you decide to get the entry level, non pro m4 chip model, i would advise waiting and now that the starting ram is finally 16.
the very entry level models are usually the ones to be found on sale around 300400 off around 36 months after release.
personally i would go with the pro model especially if i want to keep it 5 years as that also usually drops around 200250 around in the same time period, basically bringing it down to the starting msrp of the regular m4.
good time to be a mac user.
totally understandable, different people have different needspriorities or budgets and don't know in which one you'd fall.
those are big discounts.
again, i would personally go with the m4 pro configs and get thunderbolt 5 while at it as you tend to keep computers for a long enough time like i do.
and you never know what os requirements may appear down the road.
yes, i have a late 2017 51216 touch bar with 2.9 ghz quadcore intel core i7, intel 630 plus 4 gb ram radeon pro 560 gpu.
it's had its keyboard replaced nthe a key lost its text, and eventually the a key would miss inputting, by then we also had approvals for fixing here out out warranty for keyboard issues, so also the whole top of it and a new battery, but then the screen started to flash and apple then replaced the screen, and the front allow bits on the top.
a few years ago.
it was according to apple, a new computer then.
it clogs up now and i think runs out of drive space.
i was considering opencore for it running that on my mac pro 5,1
but i mucked up the install and it took a lot of time.
plus its risky running the same os as this macbook can run ventura although with opencore it will run the latest os.
for me there is little price difference in the pro cpus versions between the 14 and 16 form factors, but a big two and a half times more in the same configuration difference between the 16 than a 14 when similarly configured in the max configurations.
i guess the marketing gurus make the pricing decisions, not the cost to build personnel.
so it was m4 ... not many refurbs in m3 max  where i am  have more than 1 tb
and then they do, they seem to have 128 gb ram and are very expensive.
i was going to get a 64 ram mac mini pro and a 15 macbook air, because the specifications for the new macbooks did not list them as having thunderbolt 5.
but when i realised they did, i ordered one.
