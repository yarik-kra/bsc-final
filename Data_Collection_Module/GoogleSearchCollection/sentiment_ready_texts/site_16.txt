one really has to wonder why they never made it smaller over the years.
especially since they never ended up adding faceid
this is hands down the greatest laptop
i have ever owned and it's not even close.
i have the base model and it
.
i used to be a huge critic of apple's approach or lack thereof to gaming but with this much power in the base model i can only imagine how powerful the pro and max chips are.
gamemode is another great feature.
what games are you playing?
i just got the base model as well.
good video.
base m4 macbook pro is a good laptop.
will be difficult to choose one after the macbook air is also updated to m4.
but with better speakers on the pro along with promotion, though not as noticeable as on the ipad or iphone, many might go with macbook pro
my m1 pro is still crazy snappy.
i think my next one will only be the m6 model which i'll only buy at the end of its cycle when it's 25 off.
i got an m4 max simply because i need the ram for work reasons, but my old base model m1 pro with only 8 cores is still extremely competitive.
during regular usage, there is no meaningful difference.
still, there arent many people buying these laptops even at around 1000.
apple need to convince more people to join the bandwagon that is apple silicon and let them develop games for macos.
but again, given the tradition for apple dismissing games as for lower class people, i dont see the trend shifting anytime soon.
in contrast, i clean the keyboard routinely with 70 etoh and a microfiber.
i attracted a 420 aud service fee for cleaning my keyboard often with 75 alcohol, and it turned out the cloth i bought had water mixed in.
since then, i am wary at cleaning my essentially brand new m1 macbook pro after the fix apple replaced almost everything screen, keyboard, motherboard and so on.
at the same time, it attracts dusts quite easily and quickly.
guess i need to figure out a way to clean it next year.
it is more than adequate for what i do.
unfortunately, a few of the keys on my keyboard have suddenly stopped working reliably.
of course, it happened the day after i could have extended my applecare and replacing it is 750usd.
thank you for saying so, and thank you to every sane person who agrees.
all apple notches are a complete and utter design fail.
there are numerous reasons why it is a design abomination.
for one, the entire depth of this 'unnoticeable' crap eats into the useable height and width of the screen.
but going back to the aesthetics, it is effing ugly to see.
as is the other design fail, the oxymoron that are round corners.
the keyboard failing so soon.
random workmanship from apple.
mine, touch plastic, is going strong.
pity you didn't buy in the uk.
there they automatically get 6 years 'fit for purpose' for free on every purchase over, i think, 100.
missing a mbp m4 16.
if i went to a notch display, only with 16.
but a m4 pro is too much for me and i have fear because of too much fan noise
yeah, i'm running an m1 macbook pro 16
and it's fast.
never once did i get the idea i need a faster machine.
it's my work machine and it's got 2 4k screens connected to it.
feels super snappy.
take away from the video use your laptop for light things and use your mac studio for heavy work.
you are correct.
i think the macbook air is the one to have.
if you really need the pro apart form the name, you will know it.
i have the m4pro 1420 chip but ive been playing baldurs gate 3 on ultra settings and get between 7080 fps.
im sure you could easily get 60 on the m4 chip, though you may have to step down to high from ultra.
i have been very happy with it thus far.
any intel mac can do this better than fine with  of m4's performance.
any intel core i5 from 15 years ago can do this.
we really have more than enough performance for basic tasks for many many years already.
upgraded my 14 m1 maxmbpro to a 16m4 maxmbpro nano with 128 gb ram and 8 tb ssd that is driving two apple studio displays when at home.
more powerful than my m1 ultra mac studio with 128 gb of ram and 8 tb ssd
plus i have the same computing power sway from home.
i bought a base m4 and didn't notice any improvement over my m1 pro.
returned it after a few days.
the only reason i will upgrade is when the battery life goes down.
especially if you do not set the bar to be in that left and right space.
useless, nah.
could it be made even smaller, or have just the hole punch for the camera, probably, but other laptops with as small of bezels end up with the camera at the bottom of the screen.
if i did not have a privacy screen on my device, i would never know that the notch was there because it just blends into the top bar.
i could see it being a thing if you keep your computer in light mode though.
i have base model m4.
no nano texture because apple cloth is 20.
i know i can wipe down regular screen with screen spray and cloth.
i sneeze without warning sometimes.
tell me how you like it after 3 months.
not sure if this is sarcasm, but it comes with a nano cloth for cleaning the display.
i'm pretty impressed with my mbp lol.
i play some resident evil games, some older stuff like star wars kotor i  ii.
i haven't had time to dualboot to windows and play some windowsonly games but i plan on doing that soon.
the promotion is a complete revelation for me, having never had it before, its a totally different experience.
the other thing to note, reading through the forums, is that getting a pro chip really does give you extra longevity  most previous silicon pro chip users dont seem to be tempted by a base m4 upgrade.
it's not quite automatic!
a friend had a sub 500 dell laptop fail logic board or somesuch recently, about 18 months after purchasing brand new.
first dell said it's out of warranty, sorry.
he had to threaten them with small claims court to get a free repair.
it is impossible to defend.
it deserves to be called out every single year.
cost of replacing cloth is crazy it will get lost or dirty.
