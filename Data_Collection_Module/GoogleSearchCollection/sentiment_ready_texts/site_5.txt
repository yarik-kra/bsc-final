even with an oled display and a new m4 cpu it can flex  on macbooks.
if they dont add a macos option next month then all hope is lost
this thing will flop hard unless they pull a 180 degrees with the os for it , this thing has so much horsepower but no utility.
what professional work can it do now that it couldn't do before?
ipados can't leverage all the power of an m1 chip, forget m4.
the oled screen will be a very nice upgrade for graphic designers.
this wasnt apples ai chip.
i have a 12.9in 2018 ipad pro.
the new m4 ipad pro would allow me to do nothing more.
and given the rumours or lack of, i suspect we aren't getting much for ipad os at wwdc.
as soon as proper windowing, file management, etc come to the ipad i will drop 1,500 on a new one.
until then, my 2018 ipad is doing just fine.
now how is ipados awful?
i don't get it.
i have so many apps that only ipados can use, it's not funny.
neither windows, or macos have touch optimized apps like ipados.
windows more than macos, which has zero, but windows is very weak this way.
android, don't even go there.
you get these zealots who want macos on the ipad.
i get that, but please... i do think apple should allow windows emulation.
no reason why that isn't happening, considering arm windows is touchable, and works ok on mac os.
then again, just having shelled out 1700 for this, i get a little defensive
i do get the need to justify not spending money though.
there's that
no floppy, no pro.. it should at least run computer os like dos.
i agree ipados is fine as a tablet touch os, but i think the complaints are partly coming from apples somewhat unclear positioning of the ipad pro as a potential laptop replacement.
i think people have a point there are many ways in which ipados is much more restrictive than a desktop platform apps can only operate in a walled garden both their distribution and execution, access to the hardware is more limited, access to the file system is more limited, ability to automate tasks is more limited, ability to multitask is more limited, and the list goes on.
if apple doesnt think those things are suitable for an ipad it is fine, but then i would agree with others that their marketing and arguably pricing is misrepresenting the device capabilities.
having said that i dont think people asking for macos are being realistic.
in its current form, macos simply isnt designed for a tablet form factor so the switch between tablet mode and laptop mode would be a very poor ux basically 2 different oss.
imo the more pro feature set should rather come from an expansion of ipad os which would be closing the feature gaps with macos while taking into consideration the hybrid laptoptablet experience which apple is trying to sell and allow for seamless switching between the two modes.
unfortunately, it still uses the same rear camera sensor from iphone xsxr.
not pro in that respect.

well said.
mac os is definitely unrealistic for apple, but its key features should come across.
this is what i'm hoping for, and waiting for, before i upgrade from my 2018 ipp.
i refuse to drop 1.3k on an ipad that cannot do any more than my 6 year old ipad.
you guys who want ipad to be more like macbook, why dont you just use macbook?
i mean seriously
you guys want it to have keyboard, trackpad and macos isnt that like macbook air?
perhaps what you really want is macbook with touchscreen and pencil support.
those things seem to be terrible at least on windows side of things.
maybe pc makers just dont know how to do it properly but apple would make good 2in1?
now how is ipados awful?
i don't get it.
i have so many apps that only ipados can use, it's not funny.
i have photography apps such as topaz that don't work on ipad os
so i stick to my imac.
i doubt they will ever put macos on ipad  it would eat into the sales of macbooks.
can't allow that!
for casual use like browsing the internet on the sofa and watching things, the ipad is the perfect device.
but given its power, price and size for the 13in version, i want it to do more.
but i can't do anything serious given the current state of ipad os.
even with a mouse the pointer on ipad is also horrible and keyboard, i find using pages on ipad subpar versus a mac, even though the screen size can be the same.
the software just sucks in general.
ipad apps are gimped, be it menus, layout, file access or otherwise.
a hybrid would be nice for casual use and light work, but it won't happen.
as you say, the windows attempts were terrible.
maybe for good reason, but maybe apple could do it better.
i may try out a cheap mba 13in m3 and see if i miss the touch screen.
i understand.
i have macbook for work and most basic ipad for sofa.
two separate devices but both excellent for their use cases.
i have a mac mini and ipad.
maybe i need a laptop, too
it has absolutely class leading specs with the m4, oled screen etc, but just massively held back by ipad os.
those that want to use lightroom, final cut pro etc have all the performance they need, so there is that, but it just does not have the utility and flexibility of mac os, or some kind of forked version of it.
ipados is macos adapted for a touchfirst user interface.
apple sells macbooks for those of you who still need the classic legacy operating system.
there's no need to wait until next month to find out that classic macos is not coming to ipad.
ok.
i'll entertain this notion.
i'll say macos has no utility.
all that horsepower in the m3 maxm2 ultra with nothing to show for it.
insane gpu wrt, but game devs still prefer ue5 on windows
watch me flex on ipados by browsing all my files and installing software from outside the app store.
im going to just quote jason snell imagine how much more flexible it would be if it could run macos, virtualized, when connected to an external keyboard and trackpad.
apples first convertible device would be able to becomes a mac when it needed toand exit that mode when it doesnt.
travelers could invest in the ipad pro and all its accessoriesat a price comparable to a macbook air, by the wayand know that theyre getting the best of apples tablet experience and its traditional computer experience.
