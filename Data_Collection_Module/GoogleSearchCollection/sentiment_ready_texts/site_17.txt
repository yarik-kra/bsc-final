has anyone with a m4 pro macbook pro experienced fan noise yet?
according to this video it's worse than last year, especially on the normal m4 model, since it has only one fan.
which has me kind of worried.
the normal m4 is fast enough for me, but i'm pretty sensitive to noise.
maybe i'll wait for the m4 air after all.
apples latest macbook pro is powerful but probably not worth the upgrade
the m4 pro cpu pushes the performance envelope.
but when the only real competition you have is with yourself, what then?
can folks with the binned 12c and unibinned 14c m4 pro weigh in?
curious if there's any difference in heat and fan noise between the two.
that is incorrect.
the card slot is sdxc and supports high speed cards.
the reviews need to get their facts correct before anything can be believed.
most reviews are biased.
benchmarks are of little use to the average consumer.
stressing any mac to benchmark levels is going to be difficult for most tasks.
