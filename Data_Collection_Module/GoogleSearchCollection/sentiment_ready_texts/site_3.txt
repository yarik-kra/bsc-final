whether people use apple intelligence or not, increased ram for free was not something i expected!
m1 14 still going strong.
i think i'll keep it until it's physically broken and out of warranty.
their configurations make little sense.
i can't do the same for the mbp.
i assume the studio will get updated later when they have an ultra to go with the max.
so the cheapest you can get that amount of unified ram is 3,899 for the 14inch or 4,199 for the 16inch.
that is the stand out machine....after that, upgrade for the screen in the pro.
yeah, i don't understand it.
thats what i have gone with on the mac mini.
the max chip this time around i dont think is going to be worth it even over an m3 max with sale discount.
its essentially the same thing but with a slight speed bump which judging by m4 performance will most be single core with multi core seeing less of a boost.
i wont be upgrading from the m3 max
but i really wish apple would just add a touch screen.
is there a big difference between the pro and max m4s?
my main usage is pro tools which is a daw audio software, tiny bit of resolve and photoshoplightroom and world of warcraft.
the big priority is pro tools and i'm moving to mac because i have to move house and am downsizing.
couple of questions are, would the m4 be at least on par in multi tasking with the 5950x?
are there any benefits to the max over the extra gpu cores which i assume i wouldn't need?
edit  pro tools can't use efficiency cores which is why the m2 was not a great fit for it, does the m4 promax use a different amount of efficiency cores?
as long as they're still trying to sell ipads there's no chance of that as they want you to buy both an ipad and a macbook.
they sell ipads if you want a touch screen experience.
laptops with touchscreens just don't work, the os is designed for a mouse and keyboard.
shoe horning in a touchscreen and the associated controls ends up in a user experience akin to windows.

not to mention very unsightly, greasy fingerprints on the screen.
i'm still rocking a 13 mid 2019 i5 macbook pro, was a little gift to myself after working abroad for a few months.
it's still been doing fine for me for my uses, i've been convincing myself through the m1, m2 and m3 releases that i don't need one.
i was going to do the same for m4, but yesterday morning the 'service recommended' battery warning came up.
it still seems to charge and run down through use fine.
