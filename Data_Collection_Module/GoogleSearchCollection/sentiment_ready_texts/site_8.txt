i recently had the opportunity to test out the latest
case for the 13inch m4 ipad pro, and i came away impressed with its blend of style and functionality.
while designed for the newest ipad pro model, this case retains the key features that have made zugu a popular choice among ipad users over the 14 years that the company has been operating.
when i took the zugu case out of the box, its minimalist appearance immediately caught my eye.
i opted for the black color, which has an understated, professional look.
the case is also available in slate a subtle blue, berry a rich red, and pine a deep green.
the soft pleather exterior feels good in the hand and provides a secure grip, unlike some slippery plastic alternatives.
underneath the exterior is a robust combination of tpu and polycarbonate, offering what feels like very decent drop protection.
i haven't had a mishap yet, but it certainly instills confidence.
thick bumpers along the edges provide an extra layer of defense, particularly for the screen corners, which is something i always look for in a case.
the volume and power button covers are also nicely tactile and rubbery.
i was pleased to discover it has a soft microfiber interior to help prevent scratches on the ipad itself.
despite these protective features, the case on its own weighs a relatively light 515 grams, and it's only around half an inch thick with the ipad inside and the lid closed.
all of the speaker and port holes are wellaligned, while the top cover is a particularly notable protective feature, and completely covers the screen when closed.
it also plays nice with the ipad's sleepwake feature.
it's a welcome additional layer of protection against scratches and minor impacts when stowed in a bag on your commute.
its adjustable magnetic stand offers 10 different angles, which makes it suitable for various activities, whether you're browsing, typing, drawing with apple pencil, or watching media.
an extra thoughtful detail is the presence of air flow vents to prevent overheating during extended use or intensive bouts of gaming.
during testing, i found the magnetic functionality particularly clever.
by flipping up and exposing the magnetic feet in the kickstand, i could easily attach my ipad to metal surfaces like a refrigerator door.
if you follow recipe instructions in the kitchen, this frees up valuable counter space.
just be mindful not to slam the fridge door while the ipad is attached.
zugu also includes a couple of neat storage options for the apple pencil.
a recess along the side allows for easy snapon wireless charging, while an elastic pocket on the back provides added security during transport.
given that the 13inch ipad pro starts at 1299, there's really no point cutting corners when it comes to ensuring it's protected at all times.
i wouldn't skimp when choosing a laptop case, and the same applies here.
for me, the zugu case for m4 ipad pro offers a compelling balance of protection, functionality, and style, at a competitive 79.99 starting price.
its versatile stand options, secure magnetic mounting, and thoughtful design features like air vents and apple pencil integration set it apart from many competitors.
while the magnets are generally strong, i'd still advise exercising caution when mounting the case on a vertical surface.
overall though, it's a solid choice for those seeking a premium, featurerich case for their ipad pro.
the zugu case for ipad pro is available directly from zugu's website, starting at 79.99.
zugu also offers variants for other ipad models, including the 11inch ipad pro, the standard ipad, ipad air, and ipad mini.
each zugu case purchase also contributes funds to children international, a humanitarian organization focused on helping kids around the world learn the skills needed to break free from poverty.
zugu has so far donated over 1 million to the cause, according to its website.
no other compensation was received.
i put down a small pad between the table and cover to prevent any potential problem.
mine makes my air 4 not seem as light...but i wouldn't trade this case for any other.
i will also be putting one of these bad boys on my mini 7 when it releases.
after using it for years i can finally say one of the most worse uncomfortable cases i used , after going back to more basic light weight like the andar leather case i can use my ipad a lot better and its actually comfortable to write on even with your hand and arm laying flat on the screen unlike this case where it has a ridge that just annoys when writing on
looks like you are showing the case magnetically sticking to the stainless steel refrigerator door.
how exactly did you do that?
i'm sure many children would like to know because their mommies can't stick the child's precious art project on their modern stainless steel refrigerator the magnetic doesn't work on that surface.
i have a bosch refrigerator with stainless steel finish and magnets will stick to it.
ferromagnetism is what causes everyday refrigerator magnets to stick to things solidly.
stainless steels that are ferromagnetic allow magnets to stick to them firmly.
different types of stainless steels can generally be divided into two broad categories.
ferritic stainless steels, including grades 430 and 434, are magnetic due to their fundamental atomic structure, which has a high concentration of iron combined with chromium, molybdenum and silicon.
austenitic stainless steels, the second of the two categories, include grades 304 and 316.
they are nonmagnetic since the iron is alloyed with nickel, manganese, carbon and nitrogen.
we took some magnets to costco, home depot, lowe's when we bought our fridge and found ones that magnets stuck to.
plenty of papers stuck to my lg lfxs28968s00 and samsung rf263beaesr with magnets and both are stainless.
i'm a huge fan of zugu cases and its the only case i now use for the ipads in my family and ipads i bought for my parents.
they are sturdy as hell yet not bulky, and most importantly the stand mechanism is the most robust i've found.
it never spontaneously collapses like with other cases.
work great on airplane seat tray, or uneven surfaces like in bed, wherever.
by far my favorite case for ipad and only one i will get now!
im in the market for a case for the m4.
i dont think i want a magnet case like this.
with some refrigerators and some types of magnets creates a very weak bond.
it all depends how the magnets are laid out on the surface that is being applied to the refrigerator.
besides this case is way too heavy.
maybe it goes to a good cause.
but overall i wouldnt use this case thats just my opinion.
as for whirlpool refrigerators they do stick
i have this case for my ipad pro for first time and it is defo best case ever for me.
i always have to bring portable ipad stand cos most case only limited to 23 angle and i need more angle than that depending if i am sitting, standing, chair is high or low, table is high or low etc.
most case in past cannot get angle i can see screen easily so which why end up ipad portable stand.
this case finally i can leave ipad portable stand behind and it covers all angles i need and bonus i can actually use case stand on lap and it stable and strong, portable stand and other ipad case stand not stable on lap and if i move wrong way it collapse.
this case doesn't and i am very impressed.
any future ipad many years in future
i will continue buy this case.
i am handicapped and in a power wheelchair 99 of the time.
i love this case more than i can say.
it has protected my 11 ipad pro one more than one occasion when it hit the floor.
would never go back to apple cases.
don't care about the suppose extra weight and really love the magnets  all of those feature are really great for me in my wheelchair.
10 stars
i bought one of these zugu cases for my new 2020 ipad pro, and i had a couple of big issues, one of which was a vomit smell it lasts to today, 4 years later, but is much less.
great!
and then they ignored me completely.
they deleted their response saying they would replace it.
i followed up with more emails for a year.
super lame customer service.
i don't really use the ipad much weak os and software so the case didn't have much of a chance to protect it from regular use.
after a year, the case edges started to come apart and i had to add packing tape to hold it together.
despite this, the case did hold up pretty well.
i've seen much worse.
i guess i would buy it again for a new ipad pro... if there were reason enough to actually buy an ipad.
when i first saw the splash photo, i honestly thought it was a new george foreman grill.
zugu is amazing.
i've had the same ipad pro for 9 years now, with the same zugu case on it.
super sleek.
super adjustable.
perfect angles for any activity.
love it.
highly recommend.
i bought this zugu case a year ago and i can confirm you that there is not even the slightest smell since day one.
i did a long research when i bought my very expensive ipad pro 11 with 2 tb
and i was happy when i saw in newer customerreviews that the smellproblem does not exist any more because this would have been a nogo for me as well.
since one year i can assure you that they did a good job in solving at 100 the smell problem  and this apparently already very soon after the customers criticised it.
i read  also about some former minor problems and was very happy that at least my zugu 11 for ipad pro 11 m1 model 2022
i purchased has not any problem at all.
i am very impressed.
so my recommendation sell the old one and buy one of the later generation.
you will be very pleased!
i use ipads since the very first day they hit the market.
and purchised a lot of ipad cover  most of them deliver not at all what their marketing wants you to believe..
i purchased the zugu in 2023, i had  a lot of bad and expensive experiences with around 68 different covers, also with the original apple cover.
the zugu cover is by far the best protection and by far the very best ergonomic one!
the many different angles in which i can fix the screen is unique and the magnetic system holds the position even if you just grab the screen and lift the ipad while positioning it somewhere else.
after my purchase of the ipadpro  11 i sent back two other socalled best covers and stayed with the zugu.
in all the years i never had a cover that was as protective, ergonomic and positionstable and very sturdy as the zugu is!
i am very happy with my zugu and can only tell you that you will be as well   if you give it a chance.
it is the very first cover i really love and the only negative point of zugu is.. that they dont produce cover for iphones as well  
they used to make iphone cases.
i had my first one in 2011 for an iphone 4s.
they were called zoogue back then.
i've had the same case on my ipad for 4.5 years with no problems.
it's sturdy keeps it safe when tossing it in bags and traveling a lot.
i love them!
ive used a zugu case on my 2018 11 ipad pro since i got it i use it for a few hours every day  it is still going strong!.
im on my second case, as the glue on the little tab to open it failed after a few years.
my personal opinion is that it is a great case, but has one major flaw.
i can already tell im going to have issues with the glue failing on the cover of my new case, just as it did on the last one.
but now i cant find any iphone or other smartphone case on their website...
since about 6 years i use spcases for my iphone  but their latest spmodels get less sturdy and instead thinner... and much more expensive.
since i know now the wonderful zugu case for the ipad id like to have a zugucase for my iphone as well...
the refrigerator option is only a sort of spin off of the excellent option to fix the angle in 12 different angles !
to assure that all these angles are perfectly fixed the zugu has a lot of powerful magnets.
this amount of magnets is that powerful that they hold also the ipad on the surface of ar efrigerator or a similar surface.
as for me, i will never use this possibility because i have enough space in my kitchen to put it...
so  all in all this refrigeratoroption is just that....
do you think the bumper should be thinner or good as it is?
what model case do you have?
