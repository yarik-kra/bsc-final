I got my M1 MacBook Pro on launch day when they released stock in the app overnight. But it seems like that’s not happening with the M4 MacBook Pro launch today. Has anyone gone to an Apple Store that’s opened here in the states? Did they have configurations other than the base models? I’m hoping to find a M4 Max 64GB 2TB, and I might even make the trip to a store if there’s a chance of getting one.
I am far from an Apple expert, but with the delay that was present from the start for the bulk of the Configure To Order machines. It seems like Apple optimized heavily for base models on launch day. So stores might have some CTO stock, but probably for orders that were cancelled.
Use the app Inventory Watch. Right now there are nothing in my area but the configs shown on the Website (M4 Max maxes out at 16/40/48GB/1TB). Ample supply of all 4 configs though.
Thanks for the heads up! I’ll definitely check out the app. I even went on an hour-long trip to the Apple Store to find that the configuration I wanted wasn’t available. They were able to check other stores and found slightly different configurations in stock at some locations, but they couldn’t guarantee that they’d be there when I arrived.
Well, I’ll keep an eye on it today, but it seems like I’ll have to place an order! Thanks for the feedback.
I walked in to my Apple Store and traded in my M1 Pro for an M4 pro and was in and out in about 20 minutes
Was just in the mall. There appears to be an unlisted (on the website) CTO model in store according to the app on the display models. 14 inch, M4 Pro, 48 / 2TB / nano texture.
My store in Minneapolis (Ridgedale Mall) only had the stock configurations.  I walked in, traded in my iPad Pro for 520 bucks and walked out with a M4 Pro 16" cheapest config.  I would have preferred a 1 TB hard drive.
Yeah, doesn't look like stores have any non-standard models, from what I can see.  Usually there was at least one.
