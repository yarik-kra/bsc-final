I recently returned a base M3 MacBook Air with 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage configurations to Apple because Apple has made the entire Mac computers lineup come with 16 GB RAM default with no price changes. I was going to buy the same computer again as it will come with 16 GB RAM. Maybe I will configure the storage to 512 GB or maybe I should raise the RAM to 24 GB instead. Apple has announced the M4 chip for the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac mini. I was thinking it is not long until the MacBook Air will get the M4 chip, I suspect it will be in March 2025. So, it is roughly in 4 months time.
I am coming from the 15-inch Touch Bar MacBook Pro with 32 GB RAM and 1 TB storage configurations. It is my main computer and the MacBook Air is a secondary computer for me. It is not a computer to replace my main computer. I will eventually upgrade my main computer to an Apple silicon 16-inch MacBook Pro but it can wait.
I will use the MacBook Air for Mac/iOS development and it can also be used as a family computer. So, that is why it is a secondary computer. When I had the base M3 MacBook Air, I noticed in the Activity Monitor that the memory pressure is yellow and this is with Xcode opened with Safari with roughly 40 tabs opened and with productivity apps running, e.g. Mail, Notes, Calendar etc.
I can wait until March as I am not desperate to upgrade my main computer nor am I desperate for a secondary computer. Maybe the M4 will not be that much of a significant upgrade compared to M3. I think CPU-wise, it is negligible in my use case. The other upgrades I reckon could be the web cam and I suppose Thunderbolt 5.

Wouldn't an iMac make for a better family computer, since it's got a big screen and everyone always knows where to find it? ðŸ¤”
Regardless, iMacs and MacBook Airs have nearly identical specs apart from the laptop form factor and the lack of fans in the Air, so if you want to know what to look forward to with the M4 MacBook Air, just look at the M4 iMac and you can make a good guess based on that.
It is not going to work in our house as sometimes a family member might be using it in the living room, or dining room or in the bedroom or away from home. So, the iMac doesn't really work for us and we don't have a desk to dedicate for the iMac.
That's interesting! I will check out the iMac computer specifications. I hope the web camera will be upgraded on the MacBook Air, I like the desk view feature.
I Picked up the M3 MacBook Air 16GB 2 Days ago ,  the M4 will not be that much of a spec bump.
I didn't need the M4.  I actually picked up a just arrived M2 MBA with 16/256 for $799 at Best Buy.  The normal price will be $999 but they have it on sale and it only just released as the "new" base model M2 on 10/30.  Im a light user but didn't want 8gb memory.  So 16gb memory for $799....I'm a happy camper
M4, 16GB, dual external monitor support, probably Center Stage camera, and maybe brighter display.
There will be no mystery about the M4 Air for both performance and release date, and it'll come out in March because they are now targeting a yearly release at Nov/March for Pros and Airs just like they do for iphones.
The performance specs are out in the Mac Mini, and Base M4 Macbook Pro. It will have the exact same performance specs doing simple things, and worse under high load because it has no fan. So just look those up, is it adequate? If yes then wait for the air. If no, do you need more ports? Then buy the base M4 Pro
Wonâ€™t the Air be substantially faster than your Pro?   Why not make the Pro the family machine?
I'm trying to wait for a M4 MBA, but I fear a heavily discounted M2 or M3 on Black Friday will be very tempting.
It feels like a long wait for the M4 Air with the M4 iPad Pro being released in May. What with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage being a pre-requisite for me, thereâ€™s a chance that in a few months time Iâ€™ll be able to pick up a slightly used or refurbished (not from Apple) M4 MacBook Pro for the same price as a new M4 Air.
I could also be tempted by an M3 MacBook Air on Black Friday, but it would have to be a great deal to make the change now.
If it's a good deal, that might be the better call. I know that we all like to have the newest and shiniest thing, but I doubt that there's anything that you
the M4 for that an M3 or even M2 model won't handle very well. We're passed the point where these devices are overkill for most people.
Wait for the M4. Hopefully even better on battery life.
Depends on the definition of a "heavy" discount. But in many cases, it probably not worth waiting.
Based on Apple prices, an M3 MBA would have to be under $799 to make it worthwhile, because it's $100 for the generational difference and $200 for 16GB RAM.
You are never going to be satisfied always waiting for the 'best time', but yes if you don't need something it never hurts to wait a few more months.
As far as the M2, M3 and M4 are concerned early benchmarks have proven that the M4 is a rather substantial leap in performance over the regular M series chips so far.
Expecting the MBA M4 to update TB ports to TB4 (now they are TB3/USB4), just like the iMac and Mac Mini M4 (not pro).
Expecting support for 2 external monitors + internal display, just like the iMac & Mini.
Hoping for an extra TB port on the right side (which the M4 chip now supports; it's just a matter if they want to bring that to the Air).
Hoping for a nano-texture screen option (they brought it to iMac, so it's not just a reserved-for-pro feature).
All this plus the expected performance gains over M3. I would wait.

Expecting an option for 32 GB RAM, just like the iMac & Mini.

I don't think Apple will do all that you are asking for the M4 Air. That would put the machine in too close a competition with the Pro models. Ram will be 16 Gig with an option for where it is now, 24 Gig. SSD options where they are now. In fact, if I was a betting man I would guess the only real change would be the processor to the M4 with everything else left the same. Just my opinion and I have missed badly before.
The only way to know for certain is to wait until the M4 Air is announced. I second the opinion of waiting. There is nothing to lose unless the machine is needed now.
I'm planning on holding onto my M1 Air, but I'm curious to see if the new Air will have a matte display option like the new MBP. I doubt it, but that's the sort of thing that might get me to open my wallet.

The only real difference between Appleâ€™s TB3 and TB4 is the number of displays supported. Since we know that the M4 has 3 display controllers instead of 2 then that would almost automatically make it TB4 / USB4.
M4 is double the speed of m1. It is the next supercycle where you update once and stay content for 4-5 years just like with m1.
This is on top of another great comments above about 2+1 screen, maybe nano screen and extra ports. 2+1 is actually huge cause that is the only reason why i own mbp14 on top of my m1 air.
I am thinking how will they price the M4 MBA. A M4 MBP with 256GB storage would cost $1299. The Pro have better display, more ports, active cooling, SD Card. I am wondering if the M4 MBA will still be $1099? If so will the M2 MBA continue to be $999? or $899?.
Apple may have to stick a fan in the M4 Air as the M4 runs much hotter than the previous M series
