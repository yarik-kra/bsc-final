The new iPad Pro is practically perfect. What could Apple do to improve it?

Great screen, great speakers, fast, light, Apple Pencil Pro is a game changer.
I just don’t know what they can do to make iPad any better?
This will inevitably turn into a discussion about iPadOS (with some users wanting a port of macOS). I don’t think anyone will argue iPads have best-in-class hardware, but everyone would benefit from software improvements. What constitutes an improvement? That’s the million dollar question; it’s different for everyone.
I have two MacBooks, and have no need for macOS on my iPad.
They are both superb devices, with their own advantages.
I used to wish they could make the 13" lighter, but never thought they could.  Then they did.  So I'll continue asking the impossible: make it lighter yet.
I don't need windowing on iPadOS. A tablet lends itself to fullscreen applications and focus work, like writing in a book or drawing on paper. Swiping between apps has always been silly fast.
I do want the Files app to support more file formats, including opening DMG files and 7zip.
The hardware is nearly perfect, aside from the OLED PWM issues for us that suffer from it. I would still prefer it to be slightly thicker as the battery on iPads is no way near what it was on the first few iPads that came out. Other than that, it's the software which needs improving.
More options for tiling windows (when not using Stage Manager) would be nice. Alongside true multitasking (letting apps work in the background), it could make the iPad a really powerful productivity machine.
As for hardware improvements - another port would be absolutely killer. I know MKB adds one for power, and there's always dongles, but another thunderbolt port could go a very long way for expandability. It's not like M chips can't support it, or like there's no space for another one.
Hardware wise, it is peak design. Nothing else is really needed at this time.
Software wise, Apple should improve. Not majorly, but look for specific use cases and workflows that need attention. I still believe iPadOS is what it should be. It should not be a mirror of macOS, nor should it be replaced by macOS. But there are some interactions that still feel clunky due to the OS's overall design. Those are probably the most difficult things to improve, but would net the biggest benefit to users if they can be.
Titanium frame to match the Iphone 15 Pro, to give it a slightly more premium design to differentiate from the iPad Air. Ability to install Mac Apps (iPad OS needs to be more closer to Mac OS than iOS). More robust Files app. MKB USB C port should allow data/video also not just charging.
As Cockney rebel said though, the M4 IPP is a fantastic device absolutely love it.
Allow the Smart Connector pass data through to enable a full USB-C connector on the Magic Keyboard
Decrease the new radius on the screen corners to match the previous M1/M2 iPad Pros
Find a way to increase the speaker range/fidelity to match the older M1 iPad Pros
Reintroduce 5G mmWave, as it was useful at times (and really fast)
Allow the Files app to incorporate basic file editing (text, image)
Move up to a standard of 15 hour battery life for the iPad Pro line
Fit it in the Mini 1-5 size enclosure, that *just* squeezed into most back pants pockets & jacket pockets.  All the uses I have for a full size tablet require a full-featured OS.  If it's going to have this mobile OS, then I want it to be a mobile device.
I'd take a Mini 6 size too, but I absolutely agree with your take here.
The new screens don't look as sharp as before OLED- they need to increase the resolution as they did on the iPhone to match the previous (2012) levels of sharpness. OLED's have that grainy effect if you look closely, which can be hidden by high enough resolution.
Action button. Pretty disappointed it wasn’t added to the m4s. Can’t be too hard to do.
Maybe a Dynamic Island with bezels as slim as iPhone. However, add a setting that brings back the current sized bezels as software for palm rejection. Enable and disable that setting depending on if you’re watching a video, gaming, drawing, etc
I want 2 specific hardware and 2 specific software changes.
For the hardware I want another USB-C port and dual cameras for spatial video. With software I want native Mac app support on iPadOS and I want them to make external display support feel like its not a beta feature.
No new features, just refine and optimize what’s already there.
Get rid of the Homebar at the bottom of the screen display. This is an annoying, useless artifact.
If we're touching on software- multi user accounts is essential if I'm ever buying another iPad. I can't see any arguments from consumers against this simple change.
a decent Remote Desktop client for iOS to control Macs at base
