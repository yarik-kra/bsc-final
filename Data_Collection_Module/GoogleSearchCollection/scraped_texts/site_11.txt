We are expecting some iPad Pro's with OLED screens with a new aluminium keyboard, a 12.9" iPad Air and a new Apple Pencil.
M4 iPad Pro review: Well, now you’re just showing off
This tablet offers much more than you’ll actually need.
iPad Pro (2024) review: So very nice, and so very expensive
Apple’s latest iPad Pro is super powerful as well as incredibly expensive. It’s a delight to use, but is it right for you?
Apple iPad Pro (2024) review: the best kind of overkill
Not an iPad Pro Review: Why iPadOS Still Doesn’t Get the Basics Right
Let me cut to the chase: sadly, I don’t have a new iPad Pro to review today on MacStories. I was able to try one in London last week, and, as I wrote, I came away impressed with the hardware. However, I didn’t get a chance to use a new iPad Pro over the past
iPad Pro M4 (2024) review — the tablet I’ve been waiting for
The new iPad Pro has it all if you're willing to pay a premium
Apple's highest-end iPad still feels ahead of where the Mac is in some ways and behind it in others. It makes me wonder, more than ever, why there's a line between iPads and Macs at all.
iPad Pro M4 Review: It’s So Pretty, I Wish It Were a MacBook
The iPad Pro with M4 and OLED is significantly more powerful and colorful than the previous generation. It’s also still just an iPad.

I'm hoping for a New iPad Air. My wife trusted our 2 year old with her 4th gen and RIP screen.
Done.  This is one of the reasons I dislike BST.  Just sayin'
With the Apple Pencil in the logo, it's going to be all about iPads.
I hope they open the event to 'Footloose' by Kenny Loggins.
This is just an entire event dedicated to their new iPad Calculator App.
Wife has asked for one for her bday, 18th. Hoping the new ones are out and delivered before then. Otherwise I’m sure she’ll understand if it’s a few days late.

18th is a big birthday. I am sure you could push the boat out after marrying young.
New Ipad Pros that may have slightly bigger screens but with large spec bumps too
Updated Ipad Air including the introduction of a 12.9 Ipad Air
New Apple Pencil 3 with various rumours surrounding "find my" and changeable tips
New Magic Keyboard to make the whole thing look more like a Macbook
No mention of Ipad Mini and the one take away from the various videos I've watched is that there is a very real concern that the new Ipad Pros will have a large price like with the 13 inch coming in around or over £1500 and that may be why there will be a larger Air to pacify people somewhat.
Seems to be quite a lot of suggestions that AI will feature heavily in conjunction with the new IOS.
It'd be typical if they redesigned the Magic Keyboard for Macs too as I've just been out and bought one
I would love to see a new ipad mini...i know, talk is not this time!
Remember you have 14 days to return it for a full refund.
AirPods Max refresh would be good. Not sure how likely it is though.
According to the reliable sources the only update the Max will be getting any time soon is a USB C port, not even a chip update to support adaptive transparency etc.
You’re forgetting the rumour of new colours! But not till 2025 so very unlikely for this event. Would like to be wrong as I fancy a pair although ideally with all the features the AirPods Pro 2 have.
I don’t see what can really be offered around iPad unless there is some really out there new innovation we don’t know about. Otherwise a hard sell unless you’re a serious creative.
Oh wow looks like my wallet will be a big hit the wife wants a new iPad Pro after her old one broke. Will be interesting to see how the design changes.
