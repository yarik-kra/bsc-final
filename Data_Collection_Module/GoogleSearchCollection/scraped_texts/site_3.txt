M4 pro gets 24gb instead of 18gb as standard, for what seems the same price as before.
Whether people use apple intelligence or not, increased RAM for free was not something I expected!
M1 14" still going strong. I think I'll keep it until it's physically broken and out of warranty.
Their configurations make little sense. I have just pre-ordered a mac mini with the top spec M4 Pro SOC along with 64gb memory. I can't do the same for the MBP. It maxes out at 48 and I have to go to the max to be able to get 64gb.
And is that the end of it? I assume the studio will get updated later when they have an Ultra to go with the Max.
Yes it seems like 64GB is limited to the M4 Max 40 core GPU selection. So the cheapest you can get that amount of unified ram is £3,899 for the 14inch or £4,199 for the 16inch.
That is the stand out machine....after that, upgrade for the screen in the Pro.
I just looked and you can get 128GB Ram on the M4 MAX MBP 16
Strange as you can get 64GB on the M1 Pro 12 Core 16 Core GPU on the Mac mini.
M3 Max looks like its holding its own against the M4 max.. I think of all of the iterations the max is by far the most underwhelming.
Yeah, I don't understand it. I would think 64gb memory would be popular coupled with the pro processor. Thats what I have gone with on the mac mini.
You could on the m3 max. The Max chip this time around I don’t think is going to be worth it even over an m3 max with sale discount. It’s essentially the same thing but with a slight speed bump which judging by m4 performance will most be single core with multi core seeing less of a boost.
I wont be upgrading from the M3 max but I really wish Apple would just add a touch screen.
Is there a big difference between the pro and max M4s?
My main usage is Pro Tools which is a DAW (audio software), tiny bit of resolve and photoshop/lightroom and World of Warcraft.  The big priority is Pro Tools and I'm moving to Mac because I have to move house and am downsizing.  Currently on Ryzen 5950x.
Couple of questions are, would the m4 be at least on par in multi tasking with the 5950x?  Are there any benefits to the Max over the extra GPU cores (which I assume I wouldn't need)?
Edit - Pro Tools can't use efficiency cores which is why the m2 was not a great fit for it, does the m4 pro/max use a different amount of efficiency cores?
As long as they're still trying to sell iPads there's no chance of that as they want you to buy BOTH an iPad and a Macbook.
They sell iPads if you want a touch screen experience. Laptops with touchscreens just don't work, the OS is designed for a mouse and keyboard. Shoe horning in a touchscreen and the associated controls ends up in a user experience akin to Windows.

Not to mention very unsightly, greasy fingerprints on the screen.
I'm still rocking a 13" mid 2019 i5 macbook pro, was a little gift to myself after working abroad for a few months.
It's still been doing fine for me for my uses, I've been convincing myself through the M1, M2 and M3 releases that I don't need one.
I was going to do the same for M4, but yesterday morning the 'Service Recommended' battery warning came up. It still seems to charge and run down through use fine.
