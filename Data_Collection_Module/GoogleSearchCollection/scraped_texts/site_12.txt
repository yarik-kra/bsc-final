I am considering upgrading from a 2017 NTB MacBook Pro to M4.
Is there any information available about the CPU/GPU performance of the M4 versus the Intel chip in the 2017 machine?
Also has there been any change in the SSD and RAM used in these machines since 2017?
Is anyone else in the same boat considering upgrading from a 2017 model?
I’m also planning to upgrade from a 2017 Intel MacBook Pro to a 14” M4 model. I can’t decide whether M4 or M4 Pro is better. I don’t do anything too heavy but I plan on keeping this machine for at least 5 years. I’m also torn on the standard vs nano-texture display. I’m going to wait until deep dive reviews and comparisons are posted before deciding.
If you decide to get the entry level, non pro M4 chip model, I would advise waiting (and now that the starting RAM is finally 16). The very entry level models are usually the ones to be found on sale around $300-400 off around 3-6 months after release. Personally I would go with the Pro model (especially if I want to keep it 5+ years) as that also usually drops around $200-250 around in the same time period, basically bringing it down to the starting MSRP of the regular M4. Good time to be a mac user.
Totally understandable, different people have different needs/priorities or budgets and don't know in which one you'd fall. Those are big discounts. Again, I would personally go with the M4 Pro configs (and get Thunderbolt 5 while at it) as you tend to keep computers for a long enough time (like I do). And you never know what OS requirements may appear down the road. Apple just killed off the 8GB RAM computers so there is some writing on the wall. Personally, I would not purchase a Mac in (basically) 2025 with less than 24gb of ram unless it's some quick budget purchase.
Yes, I have a late 2017 512/16 touch bar with 2.9 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7, Intel 630 plus 4 GB Ram Radeon Pro 560 GPU. A touch bar with four T-3 ports. It's had its keyboard replaced n(the "A" key lost its text, and eventually the "A" key would miss inputting, by then we also had approvals for fixing here out out warranty for keyboard issues, so also the whole top of it and a new battery, but then the screen started to flash and Apple then replaced the screen, and the front allow bits on the top. A few years ago. It was according to Apple, a new computer then. It clogs up now and I think runs out of drive space. I was considering OpenCore for it (running that on my mac pro 5,1) but I mucked up the install and it took a lot of time. Plus its risky running the same OS as this MacBook can run (Ventura although with Opencore it will run the latest OS).
I've ordered a 16" Nano 2TB/48 GB Pro. The alternative for me is a 1 TB/64 GB Max 14" Nano. For me there is little price difference in the Pro CPUs versions between the 14" and 16" form factors, but a big (two and a half times more in the same configuration) difference between the 16" than a 14" when similarly configured in the Max configurations. No idea why _ I guess the marketing gurus make the pricing decisions, not the cost to build personnel.
I also looked at a refurb M3 Max 1TB/48 GB but without Thunderbolt 5 I reckon 1 TB will become too small. So it was M4 ... not many refurbs in M3 Max - where I am - have more than 1 TB and then they do, they seem to have 128 GB RAM and are very expensive.
I was going to get a 64 RAM Mac Mini Pro and a 15" MacBook Air, because the specifications for the new MacBooks did not list them as having thunderbolt 5. But when I realised they did, I ordered one. The cost for the mini Pro 2TB/64 GB and the 15" Air - was about the same as what I am buying.
