Is the nano texture screen worth it on MacBook Pro M4?

I will buy a MacBook Pro M4 Pro this next week, I’m considering getting the nano texture display because I’m already getting 48gb RAM and 1tb so may as well upgrade the screen too. The thing is that I don’t really plan to use it outdoors and the use cases for the nano texture display don’t really apply to me.
I had a MacBook M1 Pro that I used almost exclusively indoors and for me having good colors is very important because I want to use it for entertainment too (movies, videos, some games etc) and I’ve heard that you sacrifice a bit of color quality on the nano texture display, and that the screen looks grainy when displaying white and other colors.
I don’t have any Apple Stores nearby to check in person, so I want to ask if the nano texture option is worth it for someone like me who is mostly indoors and color quality and brightness is a priority, the price increase is not a problem, but a grainy screen that looks weird indoors would be.
How flexible is budget? Do you work outside or in sunlight? If you don't work outside, spend the extra $$ on more memory .... ok never mind, I see you already are going for 48
Honestly I would not get it for your use case. Even using my laptop outdoors the brightness is bright enough it's perfectly fine without nano texture.
I get the appeal, and if someone is in an environment where there's a lot of reflections it makes sense, but matte screens do have a dulling effect. I remember when monitors went glossy it was just an amazing pop of contrast and clarity I would order all my computers with glossy screens.
May I ask, if a nano-textured display is clearly not needed for your use case, why are you considering buying it? It's not a performance upgrade like CPU, memory and storage.
My wife and I just bought a house a few months back, and one of the things we loved about it was how much natural light we get in the living room and common areas. On the flip side, I've been noticing all the glare while using my MBA. So I wandered off to the Apple store to look at the new MBP and see the matte screen. It's pretty impressive, doing a great job of cutting down the glare without muting the color
So I'm hoping the new Airs next year will have a matte option (I'm not holding my breath). But it impressed me enough that I might end up with a MBP and deal with the added weight.
I was considering it because while I don’t work outside that could change (and having a MacBook with so much battery could actually encourage me to use it more outside) other reasons are because always sell my old devices to finance new ones (even when I will keep this laptop for 5 or 6 years) and having nanotexture would increase the resell value a bit.
And last because I’m getting AppleCare too and since the price for the plan and deductible remains the same always so it would have been nice to pack as many things in there as possible so in case anything happens AppleCare was worth it.
Now I don’t really think I will add nanotexture, it’s really not something that I need and it comes with drawbacks on brightness and color that I’m sure I will notice, also apparently requires a special polishing cloth to clean, so yeah doesn’t seem worth it in my case.
