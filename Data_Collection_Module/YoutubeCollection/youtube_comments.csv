Was in a middle of a video call, tried to check time. The screen was On but tried swiping tapped on it doesn‚Äôt work but buttons still work we tried hard reset, recovery mode with mac while apple support was assisting us. (my housemates helped me)

phone was in a immaculate state, not even a scratch or never even got wet.

Paid for express replacement which they advertise 3-5 days will replace it give you a brand new one right? then now after i paid the holding amount same price for a brand new one, went to Australia Post ahead and deliver the old phone to them.

Then today i was asking for update they reminded me again yes, 3 to 5 days, then just 5hours ago they sent me a email bomb ohh hey were very sorry we don‚Äôt have any stock in whole Australia will send it by November 4th.
AMAZING Experience from apple.

it‚Äôs my first iPhone by the way always been a Samsung user but never had experience like this.

planning to sell the one they would replace me and go back to Samsung.

The camera button is useless to me i barely touch the cameras on my 13 pro, the size is already amazing i don't want it any bigger (i know i won't have a choice in a few years) The improvements this has with usb-c, cameras,dynamic island,Double peak brightness and the action button will already be an improvement over my 13 pro! The biggest factor in my decision was cost i just paid slightly over ¬£700 if i wanted the 16 pro the only model i could find in stock was ¬£1099 it simply isn't worth the extra money for a zoom lens,thinner bezels and a camera button!
