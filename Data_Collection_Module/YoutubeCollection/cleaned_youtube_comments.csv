cBpGq-vDr2Y,I love the way he keeps comparing the Porsche and the phone back to back
cBpGq-vDr2Y,Alart If I happen to have 10k likes on this comment would probably give way an iPhone to me
cBpGq-vDr2Y,So I have iPhone 12 Pro Max should I switch it iPhone 15 pro or plus
cBpGq-vDr2Y,829 and bro is talking like it is just the iPhone that doesnt let you use all the performance. Literally every phone can be used for the analogy
cBpGq-vDr2Y,537 why would they build features around the charging port when they were forced to switch it? Come on now
cBpGq-vDr2Y,People have to get it out of their head that a phone NEEDS to have more changes to it than the previous year.
cBpGq-vDr2Y,"Its funny, I have the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Im upgrading on Monday to the 15 pro. I know its a year old now. But I still feel excited for the updates that you are talking about. I actually think I will enjoy the lighter phone and even the smaller screen. Even though I need to buy some type C cables, I think that will be helpful. My Meta glasses, GoPro and MacBook all charged with the same cable."
cBpGq-vDr2Y,Pls I need this iPhone. Who would like to buy for me?
cBpGq-vDr2Y,"Yall know what this man is right this man tell the truth on everything think about it. You spending more money for what all iPhones and androids do the same damn thing excuse my language talk text and take pictures for the people who got a lot of money so yeah, the people trying to get this phone Save up or just keep the same phone you have you decide I listen to you and I hope people will too. Yall think your phone can save the world. Its not talk text thats it. Save your money for your beautiful kids your wife, your girlfriend whoever stop buying these iPhones. Its still the same happy new year God blessno disrespect."
cBpGq-vDr2Y,Apple should bring back the sidekick design from TMobile and use that new I phone
cBpGq-vDr2Y,"Going from a iphone X to a 15 pro, so excited!"
cBpGq-vDr2Y,"Marques says they didn't do anything with USBC except ""one cable for everything""... but then he immediately lists like 5 new capabilities that are enabled by USBC reverse charging, USB peripherals, screen mirroring, record to external storage, faster data transfer. So it's not just ""one cable for everything"" there's a bunch of new stuff you can do now."
cBpGq-vDr2Y,A have an xs max and the battery is changed and its so bad the screen is broken too so thats why im gonna upgrade
cBpGq-vDr2Y,Is the overheating and battery problem still an issue because idk If I should get the 15 pro or 15pro max.
cBpGq-vDr2Y,Love your videos!! What Apple Watch band is he wearing?
cBpGq-vDr2Y,"I know Im late and Ive had a iPhone 15 but Im jumping to 15 Pro. I want the 120hz, and the little bit more ram, and the camera should be a little better the iPhone 15 isnt bad but it hasnt been that EPIC either. Maybe its just my service also. I have visible service and it was great the first month then kinda fell off. Even at my house the WiFi SUCKS ASS and its Xfinity and I cant get my phone to load pics. I dont know whats up! If I dont dig the 15 pro then Ill send it back. But Im hoping I do and then Ill sell my 15 for like 400 and recoup some since the battery is still at 100"
cBpGq-vDr2Y,"Love the energy in this video! MagMirror could be a perfect addition to your setup, offering realtime screen mirroring for precise framing and versatile LED lighting to elevate your visuals. Its portable design and builtin power bank make it a great tool for creators who are always on the go. Keep up the amazing work!"
cBpGq-vDr2Y,my mind is saying i can have it obut my acct is saying no way am a lover of Iphone
cBpGq-vDr2Y,"Here in 2024 I have an iPhone 11, battery is trash at this point so Im making sure to upgrade to this one instead of the 16 since its cheaper cant wait for the new camera cuz I know the 15 pro cam is def better than the 11"
cBpGq-vDr2Y,bought an iPhone 10 XR MAX today I'm so happy to be part of the apple family
cBpGq-vDr2Y,"Mine just died on me 4days ago, only had it for 8months.Was in a middle of a video call, tried to check time. The screen was On but tried swiping tapped on it doesnt work but buttons still work we tried hard reset, recovery mode with mac while apple support was assisting us. my housemates helped mephone was in a immaculate state, not even a scratch or never even got wet.Paid for express replacement which they advertise 35 days will replace it give you a brand new one right? then now after i paid the holding amount same price for a brand new one, went to Australia Post ahead and deliver the old phone to them.Then today i was asking for update they reminded me again yes, 3 to 5 days, then just 5hours ago they sent me a email bomb ohh hey were very sorry we dont have any stock in whole Australia will send it by November 4th.AMAZING Experience from apple.its my first iPhone by the way always been a Samsung user but never had experience like this.planning to sell the one they would replace me and go back to Samsung.case closed."
cBpGq-vDr2Y,I always use iPhones until they start to work badly and by models it was 8plus to 13 and now 13 to 15pro I see no sense into going to 1616pro right now
cBpGq-vDr2Y,Yes people expect way to much of a change over 1years. Smartphones are almost 20yrs old obviously progress and innovation will slow down
cBpGq-vDr2Y,"I have a question about upgradingRead below for more info So basically I have an iPhone SE Gen 2 2020 right now with horrible battery life and it feels very dated. I would like to upgrade potentially to an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro I need at least a pro for the camera stuff, Im heavy in photography any suggestions on how to score on a lot cheaper? Theyre extremely expensive and I am not made of money lol..thanks!"
cBpGq-vDr2Y,I'm here for MKBHD's production team. Mainly the one who did the montage for this review!! Superb!
JwAfHEHQKto,Subscribe for the full Camera and Battery test coming v soon! To see why I flipped from iPhone to the Samsung Z Flip and what happened
JwAfHEHQKto,232 bro just predicted the iphone 16 or apple took bro idea lmaoo
JwAfHEHQKto,"Watching this on the 15 pro, amazing quality and Ive cooked up some serious videos and funnysatire videos on my channel."
JwAfHEHQKto,Cool review but you didnt mention the reason I just upgraded to the 15 Pro. Apple Log.
JwAfHEHQKto,Why do I feel that Apple watched this video and took his complaints and turned them into the iPhone 16
JwAfHEHQKto,excellent review. i am getting iphone 15 pro tomorrow. i dont need the 5x zoom or better battery.
JwAfHEHQKto,Why can't they just admit how much those phones suck??
JwAfHEHQKto,I still use a iPhone 5 so i will Upgrade
JwAfHEHQKto,I upgraded from 11 to 15 pro. Best ever
JwAfHEHQKto,iPhone 15promax. after 6months usage I wish I stayed with android. Other than face id security this phone was clearly not tested for functionality and layout
JwAfHEHQKto,It's so funny watching this after the release of the Iphone 16 with you using the action button for camera and the 16 has the camera control button
JwAfHEHQKto,You're missing out if your'e playing a AAA game on a phone.
JwAfHEHQKto,"Oct 31 Should I buy the iPhone 15 pro max, 8256GB for gaming and recording or streaming on TikTok when not recording or the IPad Pro 6th gen, 16GB, 2TB?Other notes I play call of duty mobile daily, Im very good so Im now limited by my little s9 lags a lot so Im planing on upgrading this weekend, Ive saved up, so Im wondering which to go for.My potential concerns are 1, I need the iPhone camera and I know its capable of playing codm very efficiently but will it be able to hold up for 2 3 without lagging, unnecessary battery drain and issues? I dont know if the iPad can holllll uppp either too, thats why jm asking the world chat, what should I go for?"

JwAfHEHQKto,"From ip13 pm to ip15 pm, and yes i choose this not the 16 fresh from the box days old phone. Smooth and fast, what an upgrade."
JwAfHEHQKto,Bro gave Apple an idea for the camera control
JwAfHEHQKto,"Something we can do with that power, while destroying ur iPhones battery"
JwAfHEHQKto,he just predicted the iphone 16
JwAfHEHQKto,i guess we have you to thank for the capture button on the iphone 16 models
JwAfHEHQKto,Hi idk if i should get the iphone 15 pro or 16 base
JwAfHEHQKto,Predicted the camera control on the 16s
JwAfHEHQKto,230 apple listened to mrwhosetheboss and added camera control button later year in iPhone 16 lineup
JwAfHEHQKto,"Good review BUT, Tooooooooooooooooooo fast for non geeks........... slow down!"
JwAfHEHQKto,"Hi, this is very good review. Now iphone 16 released and iphone 15 pro will be discontinued. Is it still worth to buy this iphone 15 pro or latest 16 considering minimum updates in latest phone. Thanks"
JwAfHEHQKto,This mans audio quality is truely annoying it feels like sitting in his throat please somehow reduce his audio quality
JwAfHEHQKto,My iPhone sucks. Every time I drop it off the roof of my house it breaks. Ive gone through 4 this month
brqtaTjBkB0,love your honest feedback about not missing out much and we dont need to necessarily get the latest iphone! cheers!
brqtaTjBkB0,iPhone 15 pro oh wow it's incredible lightiPhone 16 Pro add weight back Bring back iPhone home screen landscape mode!
brqtaTjBkB0,"the battery life and overheating problems are the reasons why I decided to spend more and just get the 16 pro instead of 15. yes it's bigger and heavier but even though I have small hands I'd rather have great battery life and better cooling, hopefully the 16 pro lasts atleast 3 years. a person I know has the 15 pro and battery health is down to 94 in only 7 months, they don't take care of the battery but still, that seems very abnormal."
brqtaTjBkB0,"THtt's a great phone. I loved the review, thank you."
brqtaTjBkB0,Wow your really good with an iphone camera! Inspiring shots
brqtaTjBkB0,"Exactly what I was looking for, very good takes and excellent production quality. Appreciate the video!"
brqtaTjBkB0,Is it worth it to upgrade from a iPhone 8?
brqtaTjBkB0,"As an Android budget user who got an iPhone 15 Pro, man I understand why Apple user loves Apple so much some exceptions Watching this from my iPhone 15 Pro"
brqtaTjBkB0,What about heat problem in battery??
brqtaTjBkB0,This long term review was so helpful thanks man ! However is it worth upgrading to iPhone 15 pro from a 12 mini ?
brqtaTjBkB0,can u share ur charging routine
brqtaTjBkB0,cant wait to upgrade from my xs
brqtaTjBkB0,How's the battery life ? How many hours to get lowbat your phone?
brqtaTjBkB0,iPhone 11 still great maybe I will wait for 17
brqtaTjBkB0,"Todays phones are fast enough and bright enough, if I was a decision maker at one of these companies I would really push on efficiency and battery technology. These features are also good for marketing and sales so the people in that portion of the company would be happy with advertising it to users.Also pressing designers to make better software that allows users longer battery life."
brqtaTjBkB0,You can still pay a 1000 or more the iPhone 15 pro
brqtaTjBkB0,"First time iphone user here. After a year of using 15 Pro, i just want to give up and go back to Android. Probably having a hard time to adjust to the iOS environment plus the screensize, but this review made me hold on to it a bit longer. Thank you. I love how you do your reviews."
brqtaTjBkB0,"The 15 Pro is not even ""ancient"", some of us bought the phone back around OctoberDecember 2023 and even earlier this year as well. I upgraded from 11 Pro after 4 years in December 2023. I don't upgrade every year so plan to keep my iPhone 15 Pro for at least 5 years.Great to see you doing these 1 year old reviews for previous year models. We do need more content creators to review previous year models."
brqtaTjBkB0,Im so confused should i upgrade from 14 pro max to 15 pro max?
brqtaTjBkB0,Apple intelligence is not coming to ip 14 pro max?
brqtaTjBkB0,You know might as well buy a Samsung they run Samsung displays Samsung chips Samsung batteries what is iPhone
brqtaTjBkB0,15 pro is all you needIt just came out 365 days agoThe phone will be good for 4 years.
brqtaTjBkB0,iphone 16 pro max battery white super bomb
brqtaTjBkB0,"Here's my reasons for not getting a 16 pro... The camera button is useless to me i barely touch the cameras on my 13 pro, the size is already amazing i don't want it any bigger i know i won't have a choice in a few years The improvements this has with usbc, cameras,dynamic island,Double peak brightness and the action button will already be an improvement over my 13 pro! The biggest factor in my decision was cost i just paid slightly over 700 if i wanted the 16 pro the only model i could find in stock was 1099 it simply isn't worth the extra money for a zoom lens,thinner bezels and a camera button! AI is coming to the 15pro anyway. I will miss my trusty 13 pro but it's time for a slight upgrade"
2LogFbMb58w,"Every phone review since 2015Camera about the sameCPU 5Brightness 5Bezel 0,001Battery still shit"
2LogFbMb58w,I came from the iPhone 12 to the iPhone 15 Pro. Im satisfied.
2LogFbMb58w,So if main camera 48 was the pics presented in 24 mp?
2LogFbMb58w,"I really don't like iphones but I have to buy one just to show off everyone that I have money to buy an iphone, because these srs think you're poor if you don't use an iphone. That's how these Sri Lankans think. Average salary of a Sri Lankan is around 100 150 USD a month and most of them can't buy an iphone and apple doesn't make any cheap phones so if you have money you should use an iphone. That's Sri Lankan logic. Not sure how the rest of the world thinks."
2LogFbMb58w,"I was a samsung user for 13 years, then switched real quick to the iPhone 15 Pro. I can say it is definitely worth it for the features and the price. The only thing that I didn't like was the battery life of the iPhone. That is why I only use it for social media and taking photos, and then my samsung is for gaming."
2LogFbMb58w,"I hate the way iOS handles notifications, and swiping down in the middle of the screen which is possibly the most common swipe to make, it brings up a useless option"
2LogFbMb58w,Watching from my iphone 15. I think I choose the wrong phone
2LogFbMb58w,Samsung S23 or Iphone 15 pro?
2LogFbMb58w,Hey! Have you Also experienced any touch issues Wit your iPhone 15 PRO? I have screen protector on and it doesnt register every press sometimes I have to press 23 times. Is this a software related problem or what? Without my screen protector on it registers every press perfectly.
2LogFbMb58w,they are sponsored by apple. dont fall for it
2LogFbMb58w,"It's great that they finally added support for USB C with this generation. Though it's kind of screwed up that a regulatory agency is allowed to tell a company how they need to make their product. It's kind of like one small step, and then they're going to see what else they're able to get Apple to do."
2LogFbMb58w,"Just curious, I have the iP15PM and since having it, Ive been charging it from my iPad Pro 21s charging cable and charger that came from Apple. Honestly, it charges my iPhone really fast. Do anyone know what exact charging speed that cable is?"
2LogFbMb58w,Great review. It actually gives you a glimpse of what the iPhone 15 pro Max has to offer
2LogFbMb58w,So the titanium spray makes the phone lighter ? Because it is spray. It's just titanium coated
2LogFbMb58w,Please review Xiaomi 13t and 13t pro soon
2LogFbMb58w,Watching on my iPhone XS for some reason still dont feel like Im missing out on anything.
2LogFbMb58w,"Which phone is better for gaming and which phone doesn't overheating and have battery problems, Poco F5 or Xiaomi 12T pro, which one is better?"
2LogFbMb58w,"battery life on every smartphones every year are getting worst, the only thing they can do is bigger mAh meaning larger size of battery, we need a new tech of battery to make battery life get atleast a week before charging"
2LogFbMb58w,Is someone else has grainyblurry photos when taking from the front camera? Looks good on camera app but very ugly when checking in the Photo application.
2LogFbMb58w,"Top marks for being one of the few channels focusing on the regular pro the most sensible pick for most folks who dont like carrying around a brick in their pocket, excellent review mate!"
2LogFbMb58w,"Hey Will,pls do review for New S23FE, BudsFE, And Tab S9 FE gadgets, thank you"
2LogFbMb58w,So many problems with them overheating bad tiny speakers and also the so called titanium case and screen is not as tough as they make out. It looks nice but I am waiting until they have sorted it out again
2LogFbMb58w,"Bro, is there a heating issue in the iPhone 15 Pro? tell me brotherI am thinking of buying iPhone 15 Pro...i am living in saudi arabia"
bxm4J5OpK8A,For how many years should I keep iPhone 15 pro before switching to newer model ?
bxm4J5OpK8A,The cameras are getting bigger in bigger
bxm4J5OpK8A,Its not better when it comes to battery life lol
bxm4J5OpK8A,"Regular iPhone 12 was the best phone I ever had. Kept it 3 years, never a cracked screen or any problems aside from eventually running out of storage. Finally got the 15 pro and it rmids me slot of my 12. I think its gonna be as good or better than the 12."
bxm4J5OpK8A,The 15 pro is one of the worst iPhones in history
bxm4J5OpK8A,"Anyone with Iphone 15 PRO MAX having issues with camera focus? image is blurry when trying to shoot anything but close stuff, tried reset factory settings tweak with camera settings update ios versions, even 18.2 beta still nothing"
bxm4J5OpK8A,It not having the camera control is a plus in my opinion. I have a 16 Pro Max and I find it useless.
bxm4J5OpK8A,Getting this for 600 instead of the iPhone 17 beta
bxm4J5OpK8A,What about battery Life and heating issues??
bxm4J5OpK8A,I think I might hold out for the new iPhone SE 4th gen coming out in 2025
bxm4J5OpK8A,"You deleted Alexandre10's comment, he was about to negotiate a cell phone, here."
bxm4J5OpK8A,You deleted my comment because I was about to win an iPhone. Are you going to give it to me by chance?
bxm4J5OpK8A,"Does ip16 pro and 15pro would have more or less battery life in a day? If yes, how many minutehour that 16pro have more?"
bxm4J5OpK8A,Pls release the vido on maintaining 100 battery health love the videos!
bxm4J5OpK8A,"N3B vs N3E the latter has better performance, better thermal efficiency"
bxm4J5OpK8A,best iphones 4...5s... 6...X.. 11 pro.. 13 pro.. 15 pro
bxm4J5OpK8A,The camera control is not user friendly and its a gimmick actually
bxm4J5OpK8A,Best iphone year imo along with iphone 13pro. Great vid!
