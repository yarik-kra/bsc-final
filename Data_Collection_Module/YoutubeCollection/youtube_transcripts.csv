cBpGq-vDr2Y,"iPhone 15 Pro Review: The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly!",Marques Brownlee,2023-09-28T22:01:44Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBpGq-vDr2Y,"- You know what's funny? When there is not that many changes, it really puts a magnifying glass on the few changes that
there actually are. Have you ever listened to a car reviewer describe the latest
generation Porsche 911? Like, this is a car that's
looked more or less the same for the past 50 years
with slight evolutions with each new generation. And literally, every time
you watch or read a review, they always say every single time, ""Oh, it's so refined, oh, this is an engineering masterpiece that's been perfected over generations. It's a formula that's been developed in the same direction for years."" I actually, as a kid, I used to actively dislike
Porsches because I just, I knew they were expensive, but I thought they're all so boring, they all look like the same thing. Why would you get one of
those, when you could get a way more exciting
Ferrari or McLaren instead? But as I've gotten older, I can appreciate the Porsche
formula a little more. I don't love it or anything,
I wouldn't say I love it, but I can appreciate it
more, does that make sense? I hope that makes sense. ♪ Bling ♪ ♪ I am the one at optimum ♪ ♪ I got the drum, I got the drop on 'em ♪ ♪ I got the lock, stock

gotta get this thought out of their head that you've
gotta upgrade every year to the newest phone. Like, I realize most of
us already know this, but for some reason, people
are still stuck on this thing where they say, ""Oh, last year's phone is barely different
from this year's phone, it's not worth upgrading."" But like, that's not new, like the Zenfone 10 I just reviewed is just a refinement of Zenfone 9. Like the bleeding edge ROG phone has looked the same for three years now, the Pixel is finding
its stride with design. But what we're really looking for is for them to fix anything
that's wrong or bad, and then just find ways, clever ways, good, interesting ways to just get a little
bit better every year, so that over a long time,
over a bunch of improvements, it adds up to a bigger,
more significant change. So that's what's happening
here with this iPhone 15 Pro. I've been using it for
about two weeks now. They've made some improvements, but now we're starting to also
see some possible problems, some new issues that have risen
up, so let's talk about it. So there's basically four new
features they've added here. I'm gonna go over some
of the more fundamental and existential stuff in the
regular iPhone 15 review, so definitely make sure you're subscribed to see that when it comes out. But for the Pro, it's time to deep dive on the stuff that's unique to this one,
the professional stuff. That being the build, the chip, the cameras and the Action Button. So easiest place to start is the way they've built this phone. So Apple made an update to the build and the materials of the iPhone this year, they've softened the corners a little bit, it's clearly still a boxy
design, but, you know, now, instead of a completely
flat glass at the front, there's this gentle little
curve just at the very edges. I think that'll maybe
make screen protectors slightly more intricate, but I think it has a nice look to it. And then the screen sizes
are exactly the same, but now the bezels are
actually a tiny bit slimmer all the way around. So technically the phone is like one millimeter smaller diagonally and the rails have famously switched from that shiny stainless steel to a lighter, coated and brushed titanium. The result, it's very
slightly better, I think. It's kind of funny, I've always associated a heavy phone with like expensive feeling, you know? Like, the ceramic phones
are like extra heavy, they feel like substance. But I understand why people
want it to be lighter. And so, this phone is
actually noticeably lighter than the previous Pro. It's 10% on paper, but it
feels like more than 10%. And then, there's a new set of colors too so I'm sticking with it, this new natural titanium
is the best color, this is the first year I am not ordering a dark or black iPhone. They still look good, don't get me wrong, but they get all kinds of
fingerprints on them like crazy. And also, my worries about
the light colored scratches, if you go deep enough, were all confirmed by
Zack, JerryRigEverything, in his video cutting the thing up. So because I'm on team no case, I'm going with the all gray phone, I think it looks dope,
so I'm going with that. I think basically the idea is, if you have a perfectly working phone, there's no world where you
should upgrade to this one just for the titanium build or just for the slightly thinner bezels. But you have to appreciate, put this up next to an
iPhone 11, then, yeah, you can see the differences
compounding over time. Just like if you sat in a
992 generation 911 right now after sitting in a 997 generation car. But the real highlight of this
build here, let's be honest, is there's a new port at
the bottom, that USB type C, which makes a big
difference to people like me who have other gadgets in their life, computers, headphones, mouse, keyboard, I just bring one charger,
it works with everything. I have already had this rite
of passage moment that everyone who gets this phone is gonna have where you have an existing Lightning cable and you try to plug it
in and then you're like, oh right, new cable. But now I've gotten used to it. But the thing is, I could have sworn Apple
would do more with this port. Like, okay, we know that they were basically forced
into doing this by the EU, so shout out to the EU for that. Now we have a USB iPhone, but like the only pitch is just, hey, one cable for everything. That's it, Apple really? So like with 30 pin to
Lightning all those years ago, the benefit was obvious, it's just so much smaller of a port so that let them fit
more stuff in the phone, plus it's reversible now. Now with this USB type C, it's like okay, it was already small, it
was already reversible, charging speed did not improve
at all, it's still 25 watts. There's no extra like desktop mode, plug it into a monitor and get, there's no decks or
anything like that, right? It's just one cable for everything. Okay, fine, sure, welcome to the club. You know, iPhone users
can now take advantage of the U in USB-C. I talked about the handshake it does with plugging directly into other phones and reverse charging them
at four and a half watts in the unboxing video, that's pretty neat. You can also plug in other things, plug in a keyboard and type
with it, plug in a monitor, it'll mirror your screen at up to 4K 60. And the Pro phone now supports USB 3.0 data transfer speeds so you can get that ProRes footage off the phone noticeably faster, and you can actually, for the first time, shoot video directly
onto an external drive. Now there's some talk about the
cable that comes in the box. Remember that nice high
quality braided USB-C cable that comes in the box? But it's only USB 2.0 transfer
speeds, it's a slow cable. So if you have a Pro phone, you need get a faster
separate cable for it? That seemed weird to people, but it's not, that's very normal. Most smartphones come with just a USB-C cable just to charge. It's a charging cable. If you wanted a data cable, you'd have to buy a
thicker, more robust cable that looks the same but is a data cable. It's kind of confusing
and annoying actually. Welcome to the world of USB-C, my friends, it's good to have you. But that is a good segue
to the main enabler, the new powerhouse chip inside
this phone with a new name, the A17 Pro. So the base iPhone 15s got last year's A16
bionic from the 14 Pro. And so, here's this new more powerful chip in the highest end phones
and it's not the A17 Bionic, this is the first one with
the Pro name, A17 Pro, and this thing goes
kind of crazy on paper. This is their first three nanometer chip, actually, the first three
nanometer chip in any phone that we'll probably see for
at least another year or two. I ran some benchmarks, it's literally approaching M1 chip levels of synthetic benchmark scores,
and compared to last year, it's 10 to 20% more powerful on both the CPU and the GPU,
which is very respectable. But more power is like
more horsepower in a car. It's only really useful or noticeable if it lets you do more things with it. I'm gonna live in this analogy
a bit more for a minute, but like the last generation
Porsche 911 Turbo S, it was already so ballistic fast that you never approached that limit anywhere on public streets until you get to the
highest end of performance, on the track. And the highest end
iPhone is the same way, like, the Pro iPhone's been great at just surfing Instagram and texting and doing all the normal web browsing, basic stuff you'd do on a phone. And so, the only place you'd really notice the extra performance is,
well, we got a gaming demo. Apple showed these wild demos on the new iPhone at the keynote. And just a disclaimer, I'm not much of a phone gamer so I'll defer the commentary
on this to Dave2D, you can go watch his video, linked below. But they literally launched
exclusive games on the iPhone, that are like ""Resident Evil: Village"" and ""Assassin's Creed"", but not on cut down mobile versions, these are literally the same
versions with the same assets and same textures and everything from the PlayStation version 'cause it literally is
the PlayStation version. That's impressive. Plus you know, performance
headroom is never a bad thing. But I think also for me and
for a lot of other people, the more impactful things that you'll actually
notice about this new chip are in the dedicated parts of it that are for specific tasks. Like, the new image signal processor lets you take really, really fast, lag-free photos constantly. The new neural engine recognizes
Portrait Mode subjects, like people's faces and
dogs and cats automatically, and lets you go back in time and set a regular photo
to a Portrait Mode photo. The USB 3 controller that enables faster data transfer speeds is also on the A17 Pro, all of that is coming from the new chip. But what I'm more concerned with at the moment is battery life. Okay, so actually, it's
kind of two main issues that have been popping up that you kind of have
to try to figure out, are they isolated issues or are these real problems with the phone? And those are battery life
and overheating issues. And to be honest, part of the reason this review took like longer than normal is I've been really trying
to dig into the battery and figure out what's going on here. So objectively speaking, these phones have slightly
bigger batteries than last year and a new three nanometer chip. So in a controlled environment, they should do better and they do, they literally last longer on
like simple benchmark stuff. So that's good news. Now when I test a phone, like normal, I pretty much, I kind of go by feel, I always have some mix of good days, some average days and then some bad days, where I can sort of figure
out what's draining it, what its weaknesses are and then I can come to
a conclusion from that. So now here we are, I
get a couple days in, I get a couple weeks in and I've had a good
amount of average days, I've had a couple of
those bad draining days, but I also haven't had
any of those amazing days where I get like nine
hours of screen on time. I just haven't had any yet. And then, we also started to
see some of those headlines about battery life potentially being worse and there's also some overheating issues popping up on Twitter or X and some people were asking
if mine has had any issues. So here's the weird answer, yes, but not when I would expect, Two days ago, literally, I
was just at a golf tournament, it was in Florida, it was
like 100 degree really feel or something crazy like that. And I'm outside with my
phone at max brightness with GPS going all day out in the sun, and it was fine, no problem,
no overheating issues. But then, a couple hours later, I'm on the airplane with
my phone in Airplane Mode and I've got just like
music playing on Bluetooth with Spotify and like
scrolling through Instagram, and for like five minutes, the phone just gets really hot and just blasts through like 5% battery, and then it's fine again afterwards, and I'm like, there almost
seems to be no rhyme or reason why it does this randomly once in a while. So my best theory is
that the A17 Pro is just, it's a more powerful
chip and so therefore, is able to drain power
more quickly than before in high intensity settings,
like gaming, et cetera. And there's also been some
issues attributed to iOS 17 bugs, like we're already on 17.0.2. I imagine there's some more updates coming to both iOS and a bunch of apps. But by the end of this, I kind of feel like I'm
expecting battery life to basically even out to
be the same as last year, which is a boring answer, but
that's kind of what I expect. Now we can talk all we want about what the word Pro
actually means in a smartphone, but with iPhones, that
has mostly meant cameras. And it turns out there is a lot going on with these relatively
similar looking cameras on these new Pro phones, both
in hardware and software. So you're looking at a new
bigger 48 megapixel main camera. There's also an improved ultra wide with a closer up macro capability and a whole telephoto situation that we'll get to in a minute. But then with software,
there is this whole new intricate image processing
pipeline happening. So you know how most smartphones, a lot of 'em today have
like 48 megapixel cameras and they all bin down to 12 megapixels. They give you 12 megapixel shots. You know, previous iPhones did this, this new one, for those
who might've missed it, is actually by default spitting out 24 megapixel
images instead of 12, and it's only about one and
a half times of file size. So this new process, which is the same
actually across the board for iPhone 15s and 15 Pros, is it's taking a 48
megapixel full sensor shot for detail information and also taking a full
sensor 12 megapixel shot, which is the quad binning for
light information and noise. And then, it's using the
neural net to combine them and do a sort of a detailed transfer to get you this hybrid 24 megapixel image. It's very complicated, very clever, and the end result is slightly better. It's really right in line
with what I've been saying. So if you just generally look
at photos shot on this camera, it's an iPhone photo, like,
they look pretty great, they're awesome with dynamic range and sharpness across the board. I still prefer and shoot in the rich contrast
profile most of the time, but, yeah, mostly, the iPhone
is one of the best cameras at just pointing and shooting, in full auto, just getting
results that look good, even if it doesn't look the
most like real life, you know, it's doing the classic
relighting and tone mapping and everything we're used
to from all this smart HDR, it's all here and a lot of
people like it and it looks good. The improved Macro Mode
is also really good. And with this natural fall
off with the primary camera without even needing Portrait Mode, you can get some blurred
backgrounds, it's awesome. Autofocus is also really, really fast, especially whenever there's
a face in the scene, this thing loves seeing faces. And the benefit of the bigger sensor shows itself at night too with even longer handheld captures. It's not magic, it's just
physics, but, you know, does the 24 megapixel make a difference over the 12 megapixel? Well, zoomed out, absolutely not, they look basically the same. So you gotta zoom in, and even at 50% zoom, you
still can't really tell. It's not until you zoom all
the way in that you can, okay, you can see a difference, you can start to notice a difference in fine detail and contrast. The 15 Pro is definitely,
when your pixel peeping, more contrasty and sharp when you're all the way
zoomed in versus last year. But that's just when you've
zoomed all the way in. And by the way, once you get past 2X zoom, it's back to kicking out
regular 12 megapixel images. So again, it's like, it's a small, small
year-over-year improvement with that tiny amount of
like pixel peeping detail, but over a longer distance,
over a bunch of generations, that's the type of thing that adds up. They even, on the Pro phones, did a couple of presets from the 1X lens. There's a 24 millimeter
all the way zoomed out, then a 28 millimeter,
a little bit tighter, and a 35 millimeter
that all have their own dedicated image processing
pipeline presets to maximize detail into these basically super
res, zoom, focal lengths that you can digitally zoom between. I wouldn't exactly call it
having extra lenses on the phone, but, you know, 1.5X zoom
on last year's phone versus 1.5X zoom on this year's
phone, slight difference. But there is a difference. Honestly, the most Pro things
about these new phones though is definitely their video cameras, so I'm just gonna nerd out
about these for a second. Because the iPhone's video capabilities, I've talked about this so much, but they're still so clearly far out in front of the rest of
the smartphone world. It doesn't even shoot 8K, which it's totally capable
of with the 48 megapixels. I wish they would let us, but even just at 4K 30
in full auto, the detail, the auto focus, the slight
depth, the dynamic range, the stabilization,
they're all world class. I mean, if you wanna just
look at test footage, the entire electric Rivian
delivery van review I did on the Auto Focus channel
was shot on iPhone 15 Pro, audio included, I'll drop the link below if you wanna watch that whole thing. Also, shout out to the new
AV1 Codec support on the chip, that's gonna play nice with YouTube. But this year, you can also shoot Log, literally a Pro camera feature. Now it is annoyingly buried several layers deep in
the separate Settings app, which is really not very Pro. But if you find the time
to go switch over there and get into Log, the iPhone will shoot
with way more information, that classic flat Log look,
dynamic range, everything. And you don't have to deal with
whatever Apple was gonna do with over sharpening and
saturation and processing. Apple has its own transformation LUT to turn it into SDR or HDR or you can go in and
fully grade it yourself to really get the most
out of the iPhone's video and it looks really,
like, really, really good. So the one thing that I'm
gonna say to, you know, because I'm pixel peeping at this point, is the haloing from point light sources. You know, it's one of
the hardest challenges with these tiny optics so I get why they haven't
just fixed it yet, but like it's pretty bad. Anytime there's any sort of point lights, especially with video, despite whatever new lens
coding they're doing, it's pretty dramatic and it
seems like it's the worst on the iPhone of any other phone. So it's there, gonna point it out again, but, hey, if that's the biggest
downside of iPhone video, I'll definitely take it. And then, iPhone 15 Pro Max, the big one is the only
one that comes with the new 5X larger telephoto lens. I would bet my life that
that's gonna come down to the smaller 16 Pro next year, whatever, but it's only in the big one this time. But yeah, it does let
you get a little further with max zoom, from 15X to 25X. It's nice if you do a lot
of zoomed photos and videos, which is a very specific crowd, there's some people that do that, you know, concert goers, things like that. But there are just very few
people who should buy one just for this lens because it also means you have to have a bigger phone and it also happens to
mean that your 4X photos just before you get to 5X will actually be worse on this phone. But, yeah, it's not nearly as capable as some of the longer
telephoto periscope lens. I mean Samsung has a 10X optical lens that blows this one out the
water in terms of reach, I think Apple's main advantage
really is just stabilization. Like, they finally do that
zoom in preview window on the corner of the viewfinder and they overstabilize the frame, so you can zoom all the way in and get a shot in super
creeper mode, it's great. But I'm just gonna
shamelessly borrow a line from Mr. Mobile because he said it as well as anyone possibly
could, and he's right, which is just that so
much of the differences between these cameras, this one, the last iPhone, the Samsungs,
the Pixels of the world, so much of the differences
between them is software that it's hardly even consistent anymore. So if you are looking
for like a hard verdict on like iPhone 15 Pro side by side versus Samsung versus Pixel
or Oppo, whatever else, you kind of just have to
make it up after a while, like, yeah, there are
gonna be certain instances, like exact zoom focal lengths where one is sharper than the other, but honestly, at at the end of the day, a lot of it is gonna be taste. And so, yeah, you just
kind of have to figure out which one you like as far as image quality and especially UI, just the actual way you
shoot photos and videos. Which reminds me, I do wanna mention, this RAW Max button is hilarious. This is a button to take your full res 48 megapixel Pro RAW photos, but it just says RAW Max, okay. And if you want a 48 megapixel JPEG, you have to jump back into the
Settings app, switch it over, then bounce back, and now
the button says JPEG Max, which is also hilarious. Last thing I gotta say though, this new Pro phone has an Action Button on this new Pro iPhone only because only pros need customization. Look, I kind of love the Action Button, but I also need to realize that it's kind of either
overrated or underrated, depending on who you are. Like, on one hand, it's
literally a customizable button, like, who even saw this coming? It replaces the least used button that was on previous iPhones because your phone should
always be on mute anyway. And so, then, you can
map this Action Button to basically anything you want. You can keep it as a mute switch and it has the same strong haptics so you can tell if it's muted or unmuted in your pocket without looking. But there's also a bunch
of other cool functions you can pick from, from launching your
camera to a voice recorder to just literally any app on your phone you want through a Siri Shortcut. Your favorite YouTube channel right now is probably making a tutorial on the best Siri Shortcuts to map to the Action
Button from launching apps, to the specific things inside of apps, from unlocking your car, to not just launching my
favorite task manager app, but launching a new task
inside of my task manager app. It just lets me, it's great, it's awesome, honestly,
I hope it gets copied, even though a bunch of phones
were doing this years ago and then they stopped. I hope they bring it
back now in a response to how great this is. But on the other hand, I do kind of feel like,
for a lot of people, this is gonna be one of those things that they play with for
like three or four days and then just kind of forget about it and never use it again. And I mostly think that's
because it's not super reachable. Like, it's not a one handable button where your fingers
usually rest for everyone, especially on the Pro Max, it's way up there on the corner
above the volume buttons. It could be a cool shutter
button for the camera, but the volume buttons already do that, so yeah, I feel like you might as well just end up setting it
back to a mute switch and forgetting about it after a few weeks. But I guess that's fine too. It's one of those things that you'll just figure
out which user you are after you use it for a while. Kinda like I've been using that Eight Sleep mattress
cover that I was talking about, I've been using it for
about three months now, this is the pod cover
that goes on your mattress that either warms you up or
cools you down, helps you sleep. Like, now that I've used it for a while, I've understood, like I
was a skeptic at first, but honestly, it's one of those things where I go to a hotel bed and
I have a harder time sleeping, which it used to be the other way around, but I just sleep so much
better in the Eight Sleep bed 'cause it's cooled down
to let you get sleep early and then warms up in the
morning to help you wake up. And it's become really clear that temperature is one of the
most important factors when it comes to sleep, and it's become real obvious to me that falling asleep faster, getting better quality sleep and then being able to depend on it is something I wouldn't
trade for anything. It's just, it took me
some time to learn that. Plus there's an app that shows me all my info about my sleep every night and it lets me adjust
the autopilot if I want. If your partner sleeps at a
different side on the same bed, they can adjust the temperature
in the app too, it's great. So I'll leave a link to it below, and since they're a great sponsor, they're actually giving you
guys $200 off the pod cover if you use code ""MKBHD""
at eightsleep.com/mkbhd. But anyway, what's the verdict? What's the verdict with
the new Pro iPhone of 2023? It's one of those things where like I have conversations with friends and I always end up having
to try to condense it all and summarize it into like one sentence, and the truth is like, it's the same phone as last year with USB, a little bit of a faster chip, a little bit of a brighter screen, a little bit of thinner bezels, and like, I don't know, better
cameras, that's kind of it. So you have to decide how much
of that is important to you. Are any of those things important to you? Honestly, USB might be
the most important thing about the new iPhone, despite
what Apple was hoping. Welcome to the club, my friends. Thanks for watching, catch you guys in the next one, peace. (upbeat music)"
JwAfHEHQKto,iPhone 15 Pro Review - Better than you think.,Mrwhosetheboss,2023-09-19T13:00:16Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwAfHEHQKto,if you zoom out to the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max I think it's fair to say that these are a fairly forgettable set of phones there is no one big defining feature that puts them on the map like the dynamic Island was on the iPhone 14 Pros or the 120 HZ promotion displays on the iPhone 13 Pros the famous summary page that Apple makes for each of their new products for this phone half of it was filled with features that we're already well used to there's not even a bold new color to aesthetically differentiate itself this is the single driest selection in recent memory for me but it's only now that I've started Living with it that I've realized so many little things things that are easy to miss things that Apple didn't even mention that all add up to make this a more surprising more immediately beneficial experience than I would say I've had with any iPhone I've tested before this especially when it comes to cameras in case you wondering by the way this is what you get when you order a 15 Pro it's fairly standard Apple Fair no longer a black box like you used to get with Pros I imagine to use less ink inside you get the phone the new USBC cable and the little insert which has your sim ejector tool manuals and a couple of Apple stickers now this cable is a bit of an upgrade with this woven fiber around it which is going to make it more durable and is very very resistant to tangling but just know that it isn't a fast cable the iPhone 15 Pros are capable of USB 3-speeds I.E 20 times faster than lightning used to be but with the default cable you will not get them this is pretty standard for most phones though okay so the first thing about these phones which I guess I didn't realize the full potential of until switching to the pro Max is the action button this brand new programmable button that sits in place of the Ring silent switch that you can set to whatever trigger you want and my heart take when I first saw this was well you can already program things to a triple tap of your power button why bother doing the same thing to a button that's just much harder to reach and the hard to reach part that hasn't changed it still makes no sense to me why a button designed around being a shortcut is so far out of the radius of where your fingers can reach in a normal grip unless use it for the camera I would say that 80% of photos that I take on my phone I do so in landscape mode and that works really well with the action button because when you go like this your finger is naturally resting on it the button's designed so that you have to hold for half a second or so to activate I guess to reduce accidental presses and then that activation can take you immediately to not just the camera but exactly the camera mode that you want to be the default and then if you do that the action button will also double as your shutter button when you get there which means this is now the fastest way to be able to quickly record a clip when the opportunity unexpectedly arises it's not perfect because let's say If instead of here the button was actually up here that would mean that you could properly grip the phone without worrying that you're actually covering the thing that's shooting the photos plus you might find that for a lot of commands it's actually much easier to map them to the power button or even the back tap feature which every iPhone has but the point is action button solid new feature has its uses and also something Apple didn't really mention but just kind of showed as part of one of their slides was that the iPhone 15 Pros are coming with a new thread radio which may well make them better at communicating with other Apple smart home devices so I have no doubts that people will find cool ways to use this action button to even control the home okay this is a phone let's talk about call Quality we don't talk about call Quality very much mostly because it doesn't tend to change between Generations but there is a really cool new Improvement here to voice isolation so I've got my fianceé drisha on the line right now she's using a 15 Pro and it sounds terrible yeah I've got the T on and it's super Lous okay so let's try the voice isolation Okay so this is normal mode and then this the voice culation mod and so now you should be hearing it without any noise it literally feels like you've turned the tap off that's crazy it's so loud here I can barely hear myself we've played around with this a lot and while the voice isolation won't improve the quality of your speech it will pretty much erase all background noise without reducing it and then just like the new FaceTime video effects what's quite cool is that these voice effects because they're happening on a hardware level they persist whatever the software you're using whether it's a normal call a FaceTime call for a zoom call what I would love is to be able to get this working with Voice Notes too because I mean clearly it can and that is like my main form of communication nowadays okay the phone also surprised me when it comes to Performance naturally being the nerd that I am one of the first things I did was Run The geekbench Benchmark the CPU in this new A7 Pro chip is coming out about 10% faster and the graphics score is up by 20 from last year which is solid and in a way a bit surreal because it's actually approaching the graphics performance of the M2 powered MacBooks but then at the same same time if we zoom out and look at what's happening in the General market these are not out of the ordinary generational leaps in power but what was genuinely surprising is that after a long time it finally feels that we have something to do with that power what you're seeing right now is Resident Evil Village playing on an iPhone and we've seen plenty of pretty phone games before like genin impact but what is crazy about this is that this is not Resident Evil Village mobile this is Resident Evil the same Resident Evil that you've seen on conso all the assets and the textures are taken straight from the PlayStation 4 version of the game and then it's pairing that with some of the tech from the PS5 version of the game like HDR which is a much higher brightness range than last gen consoles could support now as someone who has played this game on current gen consoles holding it in my hand not even on one of those bulky handheld PCS with a battery life of 2 hours on a smartphone is very impressive it is only running at 720p resolution as opposed to the 900p that the PlayStation 4 runs the game at but still the fact that it is the same game that runs on a box like this or a box like this on your phone that fits in your pocket and also includes the display the surround Town speakers and everything else built in it has definitely felt like one of those feat of Technology moments excuse the the dazzling so many times when I'm away somewhere the only Gadget I have with me is my phone and I just wished that I could have some proper meaty offline single player games that I could sink my teeth into so if this whole console gaming on a phone thing actually catches on now I'm going to be a very happy guy and you probably won't see many Tech videos but we don't know if it will yet there's only four console games like this currently announced exclusively for the pro iPhone 15s one of them is the latest Assassin's Creed which is very cool and surreal because that game looks like this but one of the games that I spent growing up with on my PlayStation Portable was also Assassin's Creed and that looked like this but it does raise questions like how easy is it to Port over a PlayStation 4 game to an iPhone how many will come after this initial honeymoon period and will they also come to Android phones later on cuz powerful as this is the graphics performance on the iPhone is not dissimilar to what you get on the latest Samsung we have no idea there is also support for Wi-Fi 6E baked into that package which is basically a less congested version of Wi-Fi 6 but does need a router specifically with that technology in mind okay let's talk about the design right now where we are with the iPhone 15 Pros is a high point we've just come from a set of phones that were pretty yes but very heavy and not comfy to a set of phones that are just as pretty but more comfortable thanks to the new contoured edges much lighter thanks to the material swap to Titanium not to mention more practical thanks to having a matte finish all the way around with the iPhone 14 pro that I used to use the fingerprint stainless steel sides the couple of marks I've gotten in my charging port from where I've well missed and the dust in the mute slider are the only giveaways that this is a well-used phone but with these I mean obviously we'll need about 3 months to say anything conclusively but it feels like the combination of having both matte and brushed side rails should help to hide that it's not the dream though because even though the material does hide scratches better it does look like it can be scratched easier and also fingerprints on these darker phones tend to show up as a light area which means that around your buttons you tend to almost get this haloing effect from past fingerprints that you struggle to wipe away they're not permanent marks they'll come off straight away if you go in there with a cloth but you can't be doing that every day so you will notice it from time to time zooming out a little I still think the most comfortable shape that a phone can be is Pebble like I've my whole family and every person agreed that the iPhone 11 Pro is more comfy to hold and use than the 15 Pro but then I suppose that thing has its own set of issues because the curv nature of the phone introduces a bulge around the screen and that's actually something the new phones do especially well the bezels are really really Slim and it's one of those things that of course you will get used to the same way you get used to the acceleration of a new car or the sound quality of a great audio system but then anytime you get a hint of perspective like seeing anyone else's older iPhone it does make you appreciate what I think is a bit of a design feat okay so I mentioned that cameras are something pretty special on these phones and let's be very clear about something what makes these cameras special is no one thing in isolation it's not about the ultra wide camera that lets in a bit more light it's not about the new coating that helps reduce the amount of lens flares on this lens cuz honestly you still get enough lens flares on the main camera to account for both it's not any of these pieces on their own but it's how the whole thing works together as a system that's even better than the sum of its parts and this is the thing that I've only now realized having used the phones so for starters the iPhone 15 Pros take 24 megapixel photos again that doesn't sound very impressive when you think that the latest Samsung can take a 200 megapixel shot but it's the fact that the iPhone can do this 24 megap by default that's the key thing that it takes 24 mapel in auto mode with no perceptible compromise that I can see not in terms of the time taken to capture not in terms of the dynamic range of the image not in terms of the amount of post-processing that happens afterwards it's actually faster here to take a 24 megapix shot than it is for most phones to take a 12 megap shot which is the industry standard default even for phones which have 200 megap camera sensors so that's one part of it but then you've got the file format most phones when they take photos they output those photos as JPEG images for quite a few years though the iPhone instead uses a file format called Heath which is really similar to JPEG and image quality but with smaller file sizes actually about half the size now that the resolution of the photos has gone up though the image size has gone up with it but even though the resolution has doubled the image size has only gone up 1.5 times which leaves you with this bizarre situation where the 24 megap Shots taken here take up less space than the 12 map shots on other phones oh and that smaller file now also includes both the portrait mode data and the live photo data at the same time this is kind of where it really started to click with me cuz I think like motion photos in general are an amazing feature I was making a little video for drer and I anniversary recently and the only way that video was possible was because for every photo I taken of us the phone was also storing the entire scene just before that shot was captured and so long as you're doing that it is super quick to then save that motion as its own video which you can put into a longer project but then I also love portrait mode every single time I'm trying to take a nice photo for someone else I will take like three normal shots and then I'll take a separate set of three portrait shots to let them decide which one they prefer CU they're almost two very different propositions the normal shot is very practical and utilitarian and then the portrait shot is very cinematic all of that extra time all of that faf and all that having you think is just gone now because you don't need to be in portrait mode to take portraits you just take the photo as you always do and as soon as a person a dog or a cat appears in the image this little F will pop up when that F pops up you know that you are automatically capturing depth information and that you can go back into the shot after you've taken it to tweak the level of portrait mode you want to apply again in 24 megapixels so double the resolution the portter mode used to be the F will also come up if you ever tap to focus because then the phone knows that you're trying to focus on something in particular which means that even if you mis focus on that subject in the moment you can go back in afterwards and tweak it and so what I'm really getting to here is that Apple has managed to build with the iPhone 15 Pros a camera system for which all you have to think about is just this one thing is it framed the way that I want it to be the rest is done for you as well as now photonic engine this was introduced last year as a level of processing applied to each image to add in extra detail and fix up the colors but when it was announced it wasn't for all camera modes for things like portraits and night mode which already required a lot of processing there wasn't enough Headroom to also have the photonic engine going on not anymore it now works in portrait mode it works in night mode it works on the front camera and it works on every single magnification of the rear camera and you can really tell the difference like I went out a couple of days ago to get some shots of the night sky and while sometimes between iPhone Generations you do struggle to notice the difference the improvements here are at a glance instantly recognizable and the other thing that they've addressed is HDR HDR in photos is one of Apple's historic long-running weaknesses I think it originates from the fact that Apple doesn't want to overprocess images but the truth is in a lot of cases like when you have really harsh backlighting behind you you kind of have to well it's better here I wouldn't say that Apple's completely solved all instances of parts of the image being Overexposed but at the same time I didn't expect a difference this noticeable versus last year's phone you can tell on the rear camera and you can also tell on the front camera so do you kind of see what I'm saying about these cameras this idea that no individual aspect is particularly groundbreaking on you it's just the fact that it all comes together in the highest quality lowest hassle way that I've ever seen with by the way the smoothest operating version of the camera app that I've ever seen on a phone or within like a 3 MB file now it's not perfect I didn't love how Apple's trying to pitch this thing as seven lenses in your pocket there's some truth to it but you can't really take that statement at face value see the way it works is the iPhone 15 Pros have a 48 megap Main camera sensor if you tap on this onetime Zoom it'll cycle between three different focal length between 1X and 1.5 5x now because the camera is 48 map and you're outputting images in 24 map you can between 1X and 1.5x zoom use different amounts of this full sensor to achieve a result that is still genuinely a 24 megap shot and so on the bright side when you take let's say a 35 mm photo it is more detailed than if you just took a 1x shot and zoomed in till it looked like a 35 mm photo but then the downside is that when you do this you're not using the full extent of your sensor and therefore the image quality isn't as high wouldn't say that degradation is noticeable but it will be there and it's just a bit icky to call this a seven lens system when really if you're going to do that you could just add a stop at every single possible different magnification and then call it a thousand lens camera system as a feature it's fine it does the job but unlike the way it's being presented it is not the same as actually having seven lenses right now let's talk about the new zoom camera so for the iPhone 15 Pro Max only the three times optical zoom lens camera has become a five times optical zoom lens camera and this is a bigger upgrade than it initially seems they've not just taken the zoom camera that was already on the pro and stuck a bigger lens on it the pro Max has a larger sensor and better stabilization than the regular Pro 2 and let's be very clear even though five time zoom is not the highest magnification we've ever seen on a phone by a long shot this is still a very good quality five time zoom camera which means that in most lighting conditions the shots look pretty good even at 10x and the lens has so much natural foreground background separation that often times you don't even need to rely on portrait mode for that DSLR like separation and check this this is a onetime zoom portrait taken on the 15 Pro Max notice how much Distortion there is on my face taking a portrait at 3x is far more flattering cuz you get to be further away and then 5x ever so slightly even more flattering than a 3X so it has a purpose and it's just a fun tool to have because 5x feels like such a distinct image to what a 1x image looks like and you don't have to step back as much as I was expecting to fit the person that you're trying to shoot in the frame but it is still very much a trade see the way the main camera sensor on this phone works you can only get so-called lossless zoom in between 1X and 2x and so the entire gap between your 2X and your 5x Zoom range now that relies on pure digital Zoom which is why in these shots the 3x image while flattering is definitely the weakest quality and as you get to like 4.9x like just before the 5x optical zoom camera kicks in it does start to look a bit rough also worth bearing in mind the optical zoom cameras on both the pro and the pro max they're not 24 megapixel they're still 12 as is the ultra wide lens which is pretty normal for a phone but it just feels like one of the only slight remaining inconsistencies but camera comparison versus the Samsung coming very shortly so if you want to see that stand a sub to the channel would be mega pixel now based on some browsing on X people are worried about battery and rightly so the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max had insane battery for their respective sizes but then the 14s were not as good and they also seem to degrade faster over time now that could be a few different things it could be the iOS 17 beta that was pretty rough on battery it could be the extra brightness of the screen putting more pressure on the battery and causing more heat on the inside which can permanently degrade your cell whatever it was Apple didn't really acknowledge or address any battery concerns so it's not clear if any of those long-term effects will be present but what I can say is that the iPhone 15 Pros are better for sure than the 14 Pros with a bigger battery capacity more mature software and better heat dissipation which should make that battery last longer over time but as well as a camera test there will also be a very detailed battery test alongside it so there will be a lot to talk about there I am slightly sad to see that the charging speed hasn't gone up which would have been one of the main perks of a USB 3 Port but at least the phone does leverage some of the capability of USBC with the ability to reverse charge your airpods what actually is great news and what I'm really surprised Apple didn't talk about at the event was that it's not just airpods the fact that your iPhone 15s can now deliver power through USBC means that almost anything that you can plug this cable into you can charge which means that for the first time since switching to the iPhone like 4 years ago I don't have to feel like I'm the battery leech in my friend group I guess the main perk of iPhone being USBC now is some semblance of stability this move was always on the horizon it always felt like it could be just next year when Apple switched over and so now that it has just happened you can safely invest in some USBC accessories that you know won't become outdated for at least a couple of years but probably more I know there's been a lot of room rumors about a portless iPhone but honestly I I just think they're a long way off there are so many things that would suffer if Apple made that move anytime soon like being able to listen to proper lossless music being able to transfer massive prores video files which apple is touting as one of the new features that you should use as well as all kinds of really Niche things like using your phone as a screen to Pilot a drone where you need the lowest latency possible in order to bring this all together then we need to consider the prices for the iPhone 15s the pro is staying at its price of $999 and the pro Max is going up by $1 to $199 to which I would say I think the normal Pro is in a really good place right now it's an iterator phone but one that ties together a lot of the Loose Ends that Apple has had over the years integrating all the bitty camera features together sanding down the rougher edges of the design and bringing a little lift to the battery while it's at it the pro Max is a bit of a harder pill to swallow since the only additional difference for the extra $100 Gap in price is more storage and your 3x lens becoming a 5x lens which is an upgrade but not a massive one and one that in some situations can leave you with worse shots than the 3x but that does not invalidate it the 15 Pro Max is still the phone for people who want the best iPhone it's the phone that I've already switched to especially because of the battery and also important note the phone isn't actually necessarily more expensive the quoted prices that Apple gives are always us but like here in the UK the 15 Pro Max is the same price as the 14 pro Max and that's the 14 pro Max with half the storage okay we'll see you in the comparisons
brqtaTjBkB0,Apple iPhone 15 Pro - A Long Term User Review,Hardware Canucks,2024-10-02T15:32:07Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brqtaTjBkB0,"look there are a lot of iPhone 16 videos floating around the internet right now and that's completely fair in fact if you want to learn more about Apple's latest offering I encourage you to go support our fellow creators but I want to take a step back and examine my past year living with Apple's best iPhone the 15 Pro I've been to a few countries with this thing I've dropped it a couple times it's been through a lot I've shot a ton of content with these cameras and it's actually got the latest IOS 18 update so so if you're contemplating on getting an iPhone but you don't want to spend $1,000 on the 16 Pro you've come to the right [Music] place the exterior appearance on the 15 Pro is very similar to the 16 Pro there's little to no visual distinction aside from a new color and that camera control thingy the titanium frame is a refreshing departure from the earlier Pro Models glossy and fingerprint prone stainless steel finish and over the past year this phone has been living inside Apple's fine woman leather case and let me tell you it was the worst $80 that I've spent on an accessory I've been through two of them already and yes the Apple Store did replace them free of charge but I genuinely miss the real leather cases that were offered with the older iPhones something about the patina was very unique based on your usage to me I feel like adding a case prevents major damage and it also helps with the resale value too right I'm also impressed with how this front display has held up after a year without a screen protector I mean there are absolutely no scratches to be seen here thanks to the ceramic Shield my pixel9 Pro XL picked up a few hairline scratches just from being in my pocket for a few weeks and it's a brand new phone that was announced last month I'm still getting used to the size and that brings me to my next point the form factor because the 15 Pro is just the perfect size for my hands and it's also the most pocketable without sticking like a sore thumb when you're wearing tight pants it also feels much lighter compared to the pro Maxes the Ultras and the excels of the world I can easily reach all the corners of the display with my thumb and of all the phones that I reviewed this past year the 15 Pro and the Google pixel 8 are my favorites when it comes to pocketability now of course the downside of carrying a smaller phone is the impact on battery life it's one of the reasons why a lot of people gravitate towards the plus-size models since you naturally expected to get better battery life this phone has been very mixed for my usage when I spend most of my time in the studio I wrap up my day with around 60% left and remember this is with very mild usage like messaging checking Instagram for a short time and watching a few YouTube videos but when I push it and I mean really push it like using GPS uh when traveling shooting photos and videos go Doom scrolling through Marketplace for cars in addition to all the basic tasks it won't last an entire day I have to carry an external battery bag to alleviate my battery anxiety I've also noticed the Pro Models year after year keep constantly getting worse battery life and this could be related to a few things uh first of all it could be the slightly power hungry a17 Pro chip and of course the super bright display I like the switch to USBC thanks to European regulations though I did wish if it had faster charging standards like some Android phones uh it takes about an hour to fully charge my battery health is sitting at around 97% so there's still plenty of life left I did notice that this phone doesn't handle hot summer days that well uh if you're using it without a case it can get alarmingly hot uh to a point where it just pauses charging when you need to top up uh the built-in speakers are great you still getting a stereo setup with the earpiece at the top and bottom facing drivers the output is pretty strong and well balanced for casual listening I've had no issues with call Quality and the haptic motor inside is probably one of the strongest on any smartphone that I've reviewed so far I love Mac safe it is one of those features that is kind of underrated because I use it religiously every day mounting it to my car and also docking it at night to charge the phone something about that snap just gives me confidence that it's secure and working this action button is new for the 15 Pro it allows you to map different functions like enabling different Focus modes or launching the camera or turning on the flashlight or launching shortcuts which can basically run any scripts with an iOS so I set it to turn on my living room lights that have been linked through homekit which is kind of neat this Ola display hasn't improved all that much over the iPhone 14 pro because the bezels sure they're slightly thinner but the Teek inside has remained the same like you're still getting 120 HZ per motion and 2,000 hit of peak brightness up with the resolution is pretty much the same as well really nothing major here uh the auto brightness setting works pretty well I think Apple has fine-tuned the the ambient sensor to deliver a seamless experience when you're using it throughout the day uh the low setting is very comforting to my eye it's not the best display on the market I think Samsung leads the pack with the s24 ultra since that special coding reduces reflectance by 75% resulting in even more immersive experience compared to the iPhone but even after a year of use the iPhone's remarkable fluidity in visual cues is a testament to the hardware and software optimizations regardless of the app that you're using whether if it's scrolling navigating to the homepage switching between apps and opening menus within an app it's just frictionless the color output is excellent but I could say the same thing with a $300 or $400 smartphone smartphone displays have peaked a few years ago and fun fact the 16 Pro's display is the same as the 15 Pro only larger not Innovative face ID works pretty well for me in various lighting conditions but it still struggles to unlock when I'm wearing sunglasses I also love the convenience of of double pressing the power button to activate Apple pay because essentially face ID authenticates you and then I can quickly scroll through my loyalty cards if I'm going to scan for points and then choose my preferred method of payment it's the little attention to details that contribute to a better user experience speaking of payments here's a quick word from today's video sponsor to achieve Perfection sometimes you have to change the game that means finding something that embodies modern design with a refined minimalistic aesthetic that can easily be adapted to reflect your environment sculpted with Precision crafted weights for enhanced stability and style whether you seek the perfect typing Rhythm a unique tactile feel or unobstructed functionality drops CSD M80 is a TK Marvel that's sleek and bold designed to dominate your workspace check it out down below [Applause] [Music] [Music] I find photography as a medium to express my thoughts what I feel when I take a photo it's more than just a hobby for me each shot that I take conveys a story whether it's the beauty in everyday life or the intricate details of a structure I like to play around with lighting and shadows and experiment with angles because I truly find joy in that creative process photography allows me to freeze time and share my unique view of the world and every click of that shutter fuels my motivation to get the next shot and this phone has been an incredible tool that has enabled me to shoot in a variety of conditions the results you see here were shot in Pro raw and then edited in Adobe Lightroom unfortunately enabling Pro raw requires navigating through the general settings tab rather than being directly accessible in the main camera app but it's a one time set it and forget it type of thing even if you're new to smartphone photography the camera app is the most intuitive that I've used on any device all the controls are easily accessible and the shutter is responsive so even stock photos come out with great detail dynamic range and true to life colors the resolution is good enough for sharing on social media and I love the fact that there's less software processing unlike some other players in the market it's not quite polished like a Google pixel but it rather delivers a balanced result with the inclusion of PR raw I just love shooting in that format and it plays really well with Adobe Lightroom keep in mind that enabling Pro raw can quickly consume storage so I would consider your storage options when buying this phone if you choose to explore that Avenue switching to video it's no surprise what this phone can achieve from HDR processing to details to consistent color accuracy across all three lenses to buil an image stabilization this phone is a jack of all trades for Content creators whether you're a beginner or a pro you'll get impressive results for professionals the ability to shoot in PR res log unlocks A Whole New World of creativity you can easily push the image to resonate what you're feeling and if you like storytelling this is a really nice tool to have in your pocket I've used these cameras to shoot content for clients over my Canon R6 Mark II and they were surprised by the results I've shot a ton of Vlog bits here for videos on the Channel with the built-in microphones and it's been great it's the perfect bcam to complement my main shooter however just like with photos this phone lacks a native prom mode for fine-tuning things like ISO shutter speed white balance and focus points now I know that there are thirdparty apps that can fill in this Gap but having these controls built in would just make that whole video shooting experience a whole lot better the last thing to cover here is the software experience I've updated this phone to iOS 18 which supports iPhones as far back as the XR and the SE in fact it's one of the things that I admire about Apple because their software support is really really strong uh and iOS 18 brings a few cool new things to the table so first of all you'll notice that my home screen isn't the usual stock layout I've customized it with my own icon pack using shortcuts but one of the most requested features which we finally have is the ability to rearrange app apps and widgets freely on the home screen without the need for a thirdparty transparent widget this allows for a much cleaner look you can also enable dark icons tin them in any color or let iOS suggest a color that complements your wallpaper there's also options to make apps and widgets appear larger personally I'm not a huge fan of the tin feature and dark mode in my opinion just looks a little bit too aggressive when you're adjusting the volume the edge of the screen reacts to that action control center got a major update it it's now grouped and you can rearrange controls based on what you use the most however after the update I noticed that my smart lights just randomly start disappearing from the homekit widget so that required me to reboot and that was pretty frustrating uh there's finally finally RCS support basically Android users can now receive high quality photos and videos view read receipts see typing indicators and create group chats a lot more easier Safari has a cool new feature that hides distracting elements when you're reading an article or anything like that where there's a lot of ads uh and the animations while reading these pages I mean it's pretty cool there's a dedicated passwords manager app game mode which reduces audio latency live audio transcription mat notes if you want to quickly crunch some numbers within the notes app and the much hyped Apple intelligence but here's a catch it's not available yet despite Apple pushing it hard at the September keynot for the iPhone 16 it won't be released until December and that t only beta form and to me to make matters worse it's only supported on the iPhone 15 Pro and newer I just feel like this announcement was a bit too rushed but we'll have to test it out to see how well it fares against some the other llm models on Andro smartphon so that'll be an interesting comparison and I'm looking forward to that but for now uh yeah it's it's just kind of all up in the air I mean look if you have a Mac or if you're already trapped in the walls of Apple's Garden you're probably aware of the tight Integrations between iOS and Macos features like handoff led to pick up what you're browsing on your phone to your desktop airdrop enables quicker file sharing but it only works 90% of the time the remaining 10% are the times where I'm absolutely frustrated when it doesn't work because if I'm on a time crunch and if I'm going to post an Instagram re and if I've edited my video on my Mac in resolve exported the file and if I just need to quickly aird drop to the phone it won't work I just don't know why but there are that that remaining 10% are the most crucial times when I need it to work and it just doesn't so that's pretty unfortunate a lot of these continuity features baked into the ecosystem eliminates the need to be on your phone whether that's a good or bad thing I'll leave it for you to decide so that's the iPhone 15 Pro after a year I see it as a tool that helps me get through my day whether if it's creating content or emailing or doing smartphone things what sets the iPhone apart from the other players in the market is its tight integration across Ross all Apple devices now that could change in the future with the ftc's lawsuit against Apple for Market monopolization but I guess time will tell if you're upgrading from an iPhone 11 12 or 13 Pro you'll notice some of the hardware improvements and as I mentioned at the beginning of this video If you find this thing on sale you won't be missing much by not having the latest and greatest model at the end of the day it's just another iPhone with incremental upgrades"
2LogFbMb58w,Apple iPhone 15 Pro full review,GSMArena Official,2023-10-05T15:28:24Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LogFbMb58w,"[Music] this is the iPhone 15 Pro the high tier yet compact iPhone of this year's lineup just like on the iPhone 15 Pro Max there are quite a few changes this year and the difference between the two models is more than just about the size I'm will for GSM Marina and let's see what the iPhone 15 Pro is all about in our full [Music] review the iPhone 15 Pro is the smaller sibling of the iPhone 15 Pro Max and it brings all of the same Flagship features almost the major difference is that the iPhone 15 Pro Max packs a new five times Periscope telephoto zoom while the 15 pro has the same three times telephoto of last year other than that the differences are as you'd expect since the 15 Pro is smaller than the pro Max it has a smaller screen and Battery like the pro Max the pro brings quite a few changes compared to last year one of the most notable being the switch from lightning to USBC connectivity there's support for USB 3 but the cable in the Box only supports the slower USB 2p speeds another new feature is that the alert slider has been replaced by a new programmable action key and you also get a chipset upgrade as well as new processing for the main camera the design is overall quite familiar with a couple of tweaks where the frame meets the flat glass back it has a bit of a rounded Edge instead of a Sharp one and the frame itself is made of a new material titanium rather than stainless steel because of the new material the iPhone 15 Pro is considerably lighter than the previous model we do sort of Miss the feel of the stainless steel though to the touch the titanium feels just like the aluminum you get on the less premium models of course you still get the ip68 ingress protection against dust and water just like all of the other iPhones the display of the iPhone 15 Pro is a 6.1 in OLED just like last year it has a pixel density of 460 PPI ceramic shield glass protection and a 120 HZ refresh rate it really feels like the exact same display as before when it comes to brightness we got the same impressive numbers around 850 nits maximum when using the manual slider and it boost up to nearly 1,800 nits in auto mode when in bright conditions the 120 HZ refresh rate makes your swiping and scrolling appear extra smooth to the eye and is extra adaptive to save energy able to dial down as low as 1 Hertz while idling and just as before content is sharp and contrasty and the color accuracy is excellent there's support for hdr10 and Dolby vision and of course you get that pill-shaped Notch cutout for the selfie Cam and the 3D Toof camera thanks to that t camera Apple's Face Unlock is very secure and it's quite reliable and just like the rest of the here's iPhones you get support for dynamic Island functionality the pills black bars can extend to show you relevant info and you can use it to quickly call up supported apps from the background for audio the iPhone 15 pro has a pair of stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support like last year they have good loudness but it seems that the base is even better this time around you can check it out for yourself through the provided link you can get the iPhone 15 Pro with 128 256 or 512 gigs of storage storage or even a whole terabyte and on top of that you can connect an external drive through USB the new iPhones run Apple's latest IOS 17 which provides about the same experience as we had before with just a handful of new features for example there's the optional standby mode and always on display in landscape orientation which can turn on while the phone is charging interactive widgets allow you the convenience of manipulating the widget on the home screen itself without having to go into an app contact post ERS allow you to customize your contacts with options like photos emojis and text and some other new features in iOS 17 include offline maps password sharing with Friends and live voicemail let's have another look at the new action key it triggers when you long press it you can choose from a number of preset actions or through the shortcut option you can assign pretty much whatever you want our main gripe is that while the key isn't so far away as it is on the pro Max pressing it means readjusting your grip on the phone which which doesn't seem so practical especially if you need to use it pretty often the new USB connectivity also brings type-c alt mode which lets you output the phone screen to an external monitor you can even output video in 4k at 60 FPS with the proper adapter you'll get letter boxing in black bars for most content including YouTube but some specific apps such as Netflix can support full screen output there's also support for USBC host mode which allows you to connect things like a mouse or keyboard and even record 4K video directly to external storage now let's talk about the chipset just like on the iPhone 15 Pro Max the iPhone 15 Pro runs on Apple's new A7 Pro now that's a lot of pro one thing we noticed is that the iPhone 15 Pro was able to match the performance of the pro Max which wasn't our experience with the previous generation so what's special about the A7 Pro it features a GPU that provides Hardware accelerated Ray tracing this means that the ray tracing speed is much faster this time around otherwise the overall CPU and GPU performance are around 10% better than last year the sustained performance of the iPhone 15 Pro was good as well better than what we measured on the pro Max during our prolonged stress test the pro was able to sustain 85% of his maximum CPU performance as expected with a battery capacity of less than 3,300 milliamp hours the battery life here isn't as great as the pro Maxes we actually ended up with the same overall endurance rating as last year's for 14 pro a less than impressive 86 hours as usual you don't get a charger in the box but when tested with Apple's official 20 W adapter we were able to charge the iPhone 15 Pro from 0 to 57% in half an hour a full charge took a little over an hour and a half there's also support for wireless charging finally let's go over the cameras which like I mentioned aren't as exciting as the pro Maxes as you don't get the new telephoto cam what you do get is a 48 mapel Main cam a 12 apix 3 times telephoto a 12 megap Ultra wide Cam and a 3D TF lar scanner the main cam produces 24 megapixel photos by default unlike the 12 megapixel photos produced by last year's main Cam and most other 48 megapixel smartphone cameras these photos come out great there is more detail in the 24 megapixel photos especially in stationary objects and we think that this Default Resolution is worth using one thing about these photos is the true to life color rendition which is quite conservative even a bit dull compared to the saturated colors you get from other manufacturers here's how a few of these scenes look if shot in 12 megapix mode these have a bit less detail than the 24 megapix ones and they're basically the same as on last year's iPhone Pros the main cam also allows you to shoot in a 28 mm and a 35 mm focal length that's 1.2 time and 1.5 time zoom the zoom is done by cropping from the large sensor and you can even make either of these modes your default for the main cam the 48 megapixel sensor and Apple's Next Level processing allow the iPhone 15 Pro to offer a two time zoom mode with very good results these are always saved in 12 megapixels portraits are taken at the two time zoom level by default these have excellent subject separation and convincing background blur the detail could be a bit better but it's still decent in good light in low light conditions you have an automatic night mode that can kick in when the phone thinks it's necess necessary much of the time though you'll get photos without night mode applied these have a realistic look with a somewhat dark exposure the contrast is high and tonal extremes could use a bit of extra development colors are well saturated and the detail is generally good the night mode shots come out at 12 megapix rather than the default 24 these have a brighter exposure and notably better Shadow development but we're not seeing a ton of improvement with the highlights when it comes to video recording the main cam can capture excellent 4K Clips with plenty of detail and natural looking processing there's a lot of contrast yet the dynamic range remains wide plus the color rendition is more likable than with the Stills and all videos benefit from Apple's so-called cinematic stabilization which is class leading low light videos from the main camera have a bright exposure a wide dynamic range and nice looking colors there's a good amount of detail too let's move on to the three times telephoto cam which is the same same as on last year's model it photos are sharp and detailed with natural looking processing the dynamic range is enough and the colors are accurate it's actually a benefit over the iPhone 15 Pro Max that you get this shorter Zoom without resorting to anything digital a three times photo from the pro Max will be a crop and upscale from the main camera and while we're at it here's a comparison of the Native five time zoom from the pro Max's telephoto to the five time zoom achieved digitally from the 15 Pros telephoto cam it's a surprisingly good result from the smaller model in low light the 15 Pros telephoto cam doesn't often get the auto night mode to kick in without it you'll still get nicely detailed images with good dynamic range and spot-on colors there is some noise but it doesn't get in the way when the night mode does intervene you get brightened up shadows and skies and the colors are warmer the telephoto cams 4K videos look great while the sharpness is a notch below the main cams it's still good good and the colors match well the dynamic range is wide too now we have the ultra wide cam its photos are good for this sort of camera they're sharp all the way to the corners there's plenty of detail too though high frequency details like foliage have an overprocessed look the colors are again unexciting yet consistent the ultrawide cam has autofocus so it's able to capture close-up subjects the macro shots we snapped with the ultra wide camera are excellent the subject in focus is rendered very well the detailed sharp and colorful again in dark conditions we didn't always get night mode when we wanted it some scenes are just dark brighter scenes do look nicer with okay sharpness and good-looking colors in the scenes that we did get night mode things do look livelier and better exposed to the point where we're wondering why we couldn't get the same treatment all the time 4K Ultra wide videos maintain the same overall look as those of the other cameras and again you get good sharpness all the way to the the corners selfies come from the 12 megap front-facing cam which has autofocus they're superb with great skin tones and color rendition nice contrast and wide dynamic range there's plenty of detail but the fine detail in the face is quite pronounced which could produce an unflattering result so that's the iPhone 15 Pro you get all of the high quality features you'd expect from a premium iPhone and while the updates might not make you jump with excitement at least this switch to us BC marks a new chapter in iPhone history this isn't the highest tier iPhone the pro Max gets you a larger screen better battery life and longer reach with the optical zoom but the iPhone 15 Pro is great if you're looking for a more compact size and is cheaper too and you might argue that the 15 Pro is not that far behind when you zoom in five times even if that's digital like I said the updates here might not be enough to be worth upgrading to from last year's model but if you're coming from an older iPhone the 15 Pro always worth recommending thanks for watching guys if you're looking for alternatives to the iPhone 15 Pro on our Channel you can check out our reviews of last year's iPhone 14 pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max see

bxm4J5OpK8A,iPhone 15 Pro is AMAZING in late 2024: Updated review!,Pedja Bunjevac,2024-10-18T14:31:49Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxm4J5OpK8A,this is the iPhone 15 Pro and here's why it's one of if not the best phone you can get today in late 2024 and that's actually counting the new 16 Pro that came out recently there's not that many differences between these two models the latest two iPhones both have that new titanium frame they both have USBC 3.0 for fast data transfers pror Pro raw and even log recording with apple prores promotion display always on display they both run iOS 18 perfectly and in just a few weeks when Apple intelligence finally gets released it's going to be available in the 15 Pro as well and they're so similar in fact that if I held a 16 Pro in my hand right now you wouldn't actually be able to tell the difference at least looking at it from the back where they do differ is that on the 16 Pro they Shrunk The bezels of the screen even more the bezels on the 15 Pro are already pretty thin but the 16 Pro takes that to the next level and it really looks as close to a bezel list display as possible without curving it of course and the display size did jump from 6.1 to 6.3 in on the 160 Pro so the displays are technically different but it's not really noticeable they even both have the same pixel density now if you can't live without the additional 2 in well in that particular case feel free to chck the 15 Pro into a wall cuz it's just trash Oh and of course how can I forget about the action button uh the action button is well actually wait they both have that as well okay but let's get serious for a second give me a close-up Zack there's no one there aside from those display differences there's few additional features that the 15 Pro lags compared to the 16 Pro first of all the camera control button is a brand new button across the 16 lineup so regular 16 16 plus pro and pro Max both get this new button to control your camera I still didn't get a chance to test it out personally but from what I've heard on Twitter's it is kind of janky and a lot of people have been complaining about just it not being very easy to use even after using it for some time the people still haven't been able to get used to it the placement of the button itself is not great and even if that wasn't the case it might not be actually they might fix it with a software update you can do all of these things that the camera button does just within the camera app like we all have been doing for years dragging your finger across the side of your phone to zoom in half tapping and then double tapping just to zoom in when taking a photo and you can just actually like I'm going to show you just like a huge top secret trick come here and just do this and just Zooms in and out you get my point right it doesn't actually bring anything new to the phone it's there is not a thing you can do with this button that you couldn't do before you can just do it a bit differently now I should be getting the regular iPhone 16 really soon I'm going to review the out of it we're going to test the button new camera features and everything else but in the meantime the camera also got some upgrades and these ones are a bit more substantial the ultra wide went from 12 to 48 megapixels and it is a noticeable difference and the telephoto switched from a 3X to a 5x optical zoom so that might be a deal breaker for you but the cameras on the 15 Pro are still absolutely amazing like I said they support all the pro formats Pro res and pro raw you can shoot log with them you can use an external SSD to shoot rly on it what a USBC cable to save up on storage all of these most important features are there cinematic mode action mode everything is still available on the 15 Pro oh Pro tip if you want to shoot in log but don't want to shoot in Pro res cuz that uses up a whole lot of memory you can actually get a third party app like the Black Magic Camera R for example where you can shoot an appal log but not pro res and that doesn't eat up that much storage so so if you're into those Pro formats that's actually a good thing to take a look at but again available on both phones if you really like the ultra wide lens and use it a lot you will see a difference in quality and if you need that 5x telephoto Zoom then that might make a difference for you by the way that 5x telephoto is actually available on the 15 Pro Mac so you can actually get that phone and still get the 5x Zoom the 15 Pro Camera is still one of the best ones out there and lastly uh even though Apple uh markets both the 15 pro at the 16 Pro as like a whole day battery life and it's supposed to get you about 50% charge in 30 minutes people have been testing them out and the 16 Pro supports faster wire charging up to 45 watts in some cases and wireless charging is also a bit faster on the 16 Pro but the battery life itself is almost identical so I'm not trying to say that there's no changes to this phone but I feel like what Apple did with the 15 series like Runing out the edges to make him more comfortable adding that that titanium frame I just feel like this was a great iPhone generation and you really really wouldn't miss out on a lot if you went with the 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max instead of the 16 16 Pro Max right and you can actually get these phones for a much lower price today uh refurbished from Apple Amazon renewal depending on your location you might be able to get it from a carrier again at a discounted price so to get this phone today for more or less the same price of the regular iPhone 16 base model I honestly think it's a steal and this phone can last you a long long time a bunch of software updates and all that Apple stuff if you really need these new camera improvements and the camera capture button then sure go with the 16 Pro but other than that these phones not only look almost identical but are actually pretty much just that in every other way as well video
YmwskGLycHo,iPhone 15 Pro: 3 Months Later!,Marques Brownlee,2023-12-28T19:52:58Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmwskGLycHo,"- So this here is my
Titanium iPhone 15 Pro that I've been using
with no case for 88 days, or about three months now. I wanna do more longer term reviews. Not that three months is a
super long time to have a phone, but in the usual smartphone
review space, at least, for me, it's one to two weeks with a phone before I'm summarizing
everything from my experience and putting it into a review. And so the longer I use a phone, the more I'm able to
actually uncover about it, especially about the way I use it. So as someone who carries
two phones all the time and the iPhone typically is
in my pocket for a long time, I have a lot more stuff for this iPhone. So first things first, I
haven't put my phone in a case since the day I bought it. Sometimes I regret
this, sometimes I don't. It's pretty rare that I
actually drop my phone and this one also hasn't yet been dropped, but it does show some pretty
normal signs of wear and tear. But it's nothing too concerning. Like, I always start to get
some bigger cuts, like this, on my front display glass because of my refusal to
put on a screen protector. And these here aren't any more or less than usual despite, you know, the fancy ceramic shield. But I do really like
the switch to titanium for the frame and the side
rails around this phone. It looks way better than
the stainless steel. It's also lighter and I am also glad I went
with this lighter color because this combo seems to
show the fewest fingerprints. It looks the cleanest. Overall, though I feel like I'm happy with this spec that I went with. Now, long-term behavior, there are three really interesting
things about this phone. Two of them, I feel
like I'm using way less than I thought I would and one of them, I'm using basically exactly
as much as I thought I would. So first of all, in the
camera of the Pro iPhone, this was the first year Apple announced this sort of neat multiple
focal lengths feature. So you can hit that 1x
button three different times and get three different focal
lengths, 24 millimeters, then 28 millimeters, then 35 millimeter focal lengths,
all with the same quality. I pretty much never use this feature. I don't know if that means I'm, like, not a true
smartphone photographer, but I always just frame things at 1x and that seems to be the end of it for me. So I just don't use that feature, even though our testing
does show that it works. But I still think the new
button they added to iOS 17, where if you zoom in on a
photo, a crop button appears and that actually crops the photo. That's significantly more
useful of a feature for me and I actually think for
a lot of other people. But then the action button is another one. So this is a pretty big headlining feature on this year's Pro iPhones, this rare ability to
actually customize something on your iPhone. So I definitely feel like the UI that they built into the
settings is still one of the weirdest most
un-Apple-like stapled in pieces of UI I've ever seen them do. But hey, it works, it's great. You can map the button to basically almost anything you want. But a lot of people
made a great observation about the placement of this button when the phone first launched, which is, like, the
reason that mute switch that we used to have was so great, is 'cause it was sort of
tucked up in the corner and out of the way. So you could just never
even think about it. Just leave your phone on
mute forever and be fine. But Apple is very stubborn
about placing this action button in the exact same spot where
the mute switch used to be, which does mean it's
kind of out of the way. It's a little bit, annoyingly,
not very reachable, especially when you use
the phone with one hand. So when I first got the phone,
I mean, I was going nuts with all the possibilities
of the crazy things that I could think of to do with it. First thing I did was map
it to Google Assistant, since I never use Siri,
but having a quick toggle to the better assistant is
hilarious and more useful to me. Then I later briefly switched it to toggle starting a new voice
conversation with ChatGPT. So the ChatGPT chatbot has its own voice and you can have a voice
conversation with it and it's really cool, but it isn't the most
useful thing in the world. Like, it's cool that it can
do complex math and reasoning and generate new things for you, but then it can't see your
calendar or tell you the weather or do anything current events related. So that didn't last long. So then I switched to
starting a new dialogue box for a new task in my to-do
list app of choice, TickTick, and this one's pretty cool. You hit the button and it
literally opens a text box and you just start typing a new task. Really, really nice if you just happen to remember something somewhere. But I also totally still
have the muscle memory to just go home and open
the app whenever I need it. I also have a lock screen task to do that. So it was a little bit redundant for me. So I've ended up with my action button just being set to open the
camera and that's the fastest, most convenient way to
get to the camera for me. Yes, there is a lock screen shortcut also, but I just find that
if I am doing something and I just need to quickly
get a picture of something that's happening or
something's about to go away, I don't wanna miss it. Like, I just have this muscle memory now to just hit that button
and just take the photo. You can actually have
it open to take a selfie or take some other types
of photos or videos. I just have it open to
viewfinder and I'm good. So then, of course, USB Type-C was the biggest headlining feature of this newest generation of
iPhones, hilariously enough. Slow USB 2.0 speeds on the base iPhone 15, but then USB 3.2 speeds
on the 15 Pro and Pro Max, which makes a pretty big difference when importing tons of ProRes footage, even if it isn't Thunderbolt speeds yet. First of all, thank you,
Europe, it's about damn time. Even as someone who is a pretty
heavy wireless charger user, I do have to say, it is much nicer. It's been great to just have one cable to charge almost
everything from this iPhone to any Android phone to
the iPad Pro to my laptop. But unfortunately, I have
not been able to get rid of my lightning cable just yet because there are still
other things in my ecosystem, in Apple's ecosystem, that haven't switched to USB-C quite yet. Mostly because AirPods Max is
my headphones for traveling of choice and I still have
to carry the lightning cable everywhere just to charge those. But there's also still the Magic keyboard and the Apple Magic Trackpad. I really don't know how
long it's gonna take Apple to go through and also update all of these things to be USB Type-C, but I guess my lightning
cables are sticking around a little while longer until they refresh all that stuff. The AirPods Max came
out at the end of 2020, so word on the street is they may be due for a refresh sometime
soon, but we don't know. Definitely get subscribed to
see the review of the new ones whenever they do come
out, but as of right now, they're still lightning. So there have been
several software updates to the iPhone 15 lineup since it came out. It launched on iOS 17, which
made all types of headlines, but then we've already
made it to iOS 17.2. The new Journal app is live now, which I have a few friends
that use, but I don't use it. There's, of course, been
a bunch of bug fixes and optimizations since
we heard about, you know, the Instagram app and
those random heat problems. Those seem to also be fixed and gone. And there's also a
curious new little button in the camera app. So if you go to Settings and then Camera and then under Formats,
there's a new toggle to be able to record spatial
video for the Apple Vision Pro. So things seem to be
lining up interestingly for the Vision Pro to actually
launch sometime in January or February, which should be pretty cool. And if you remember watching that one demo of spatial videos on the Vision Pro, yes, you can record them on the
headset, which looks hilarious, but you can also record them on an iPhone, specifically only on an
iPhone 15 or 15 Pro so far because of the horizontal alignment of the main and ultra-wide cameras. So if you go into the camera app with that new check toggled, in video, there's a little headset icon, and if I select that, I'm now shooting that special spatial video,
which means a few things. First of all, you must
turn your iPhone sideways to landscape because your
eyes are next to each other and not on top of each other. And it also will limit you to 1080p 30fps because it's actually
processing two streams of video at once, one from the primary
camera that you can see, but then the other one
from the ultra-wide camera for your other eye. So you can go crazy
right now and just go out and start shooting a bunch of
spatial videos on your iPhone. But if you go watch them on your phone, they will look just like normal videos because it's only gonna play back the video from the main camera. If you wanna see and
appreciate the spatialness of the video, you will
need an Apple Vision Pro. Now, I've actually gotten to
experience the App Vision Pro a few more times since
that initial preview video that I did from Apple Park, flex, I know. But what I've actually gotten to do with it is shoot a bunch
of my own spatial videos and then watch them back on the headset. And the main thing I really
learned is they look okay. I think the dramatic part is, like, when you get the subject
within two, three, four feet of the camera, then it's,
like, really dramatic, kind of like a 3D movie. Then you see things popping out at you. So Pro tip, if you're gonna take a bunch of spatial videos now,
that's the sweet spot for it to actually be worth it. Oh, and also, another Pro tip, it took me months to learn this, but if you ever have anything happening on the Dynamic Island, you
can swipe across it to hide it or change the view style,
in case you're annoyed by, like, a train ticket
or an Uber delivery that's taken up space up there or something you just don't
wanna see up there anymore. So go ahead and swipe, the more you know. So clearly, you don't have to
upgrade your phone every year or every two years or very often at all. But the more I use this phone, the 15 Pro, the more I'm confident that
this is one of the good years to upgrade, from the updated
cameras to the USB Type-C to the titanium. Like, there's the concept
of an upgrade sweet spot, and I feel like this phone hit it, especially for people
with much older iPhones. So I'll leave you with this. In the original iPhone 15 Pro Review, I compared this phone to the Porsche 911 in that the design doesn't
really change a whole lot from generation to generation. They, instead, spend a
really long time refining and honing in on a slightly better version of the same thing. So I just turned 30 recently. Still weird saying that out loud, but for my 30th birthday, I
decided to take that plunge too. Yes, it is matte black, but I can now say that once
you start living with a 911, you actually appreciate that strategy just a little bit more. It is not flashy, it's
not dramatic, it's boring, it's predictable, it's
familiar, confidence inspiring. Also, this entire video, every single shot was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys on the next one, peace. (bright upbeat music)"
zXkAmDIQa2w,iPhone 15 Pro 6 Months Later!!,JSL Review,2024-05-14T13:00:54Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXkAmDIQa2w,I've been using the iPhone 15 Pro for the past 6 months here's everything that you need to know by far the best part about this phone is the battery life my 15 Pro Max has been giving me regularly a day and a half of battery life on a full charge it's kind of crazy plus I'm still at 100% battery health a significantly better experience than last year's iPhone 14 pro Max that just sucked I'm not going to sugarcoat it now the most overrated feature on this phone is the ability to shoot video in 4k Pro R raw don't get me wrong the video nerded me is mind blown that this is even a feature because it's usually only seen on highend Cinema cameras but the fact is it takes up a ludicrous amount of storage on your phone and you need to know how to colorgrade the footage and post and honestly the regular 4K video this phone could shoot is more than good enough in my opinion last the most low-key great thing about this phone is the reduced bezel on the screen most people don't even realize that it's Micron smaller than the previous model but it actually makes unnoticeable difference when consuming content
WzPjIIjfnso,iPhone 15 Pro 24 Hours Later - WOW,JSL Review,2023-09-24T14:00:21Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzPjIIjfnso,so you're thinking about upgrading to the new iPhone 15 Pro well here it is I've had it for about 24 hours and here's a few things to keep in mind first they come in a range of different colors the one I have here is their new blue colorway which I think looks fantastic it's super sleek and luxurious you get some very minimal packaging here you do get a really nice braided USBC to USBC cable which kind of is a Monumental thing as this is the first iPhone with the USB type-c instead of lightning shout out to the EU for making apple take that L now one of the more immediate things that I've noticed since taking the 15 Pro out of the box is how light it is compared to the other iPhones of the past and that's because of this new titanium frame that has this nice brush finish that's also color match which is great you also get the new action button here which could be mapped to a function of your choice which should be interesting the phone comes equipped with the new iOS 17 software off the box and so far the 15 Pro looks and feels pretty great let me know if you're going to be getting this phone full review coming soon
wRZoqCZpdy0,iPhone 16 Pro Max Review: Apple’s Most Powerful Phone Yet,Tech Doctor,2025-02-09T16:00:57Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRZoqCZpdy0,"the iPhone 16 Pro Max boosts the largest display ever in an iPhone at 6.9 in as well as the longest tested batter life of any iPhone yet we also appreciate the camera upgrades and camera control button but Apple intelligence lacks that wow feature for now and the charging speed could use a boost there is some big questions that kept nagging me as I was testing the iPhone 16 Pro Max does the larger screen make it compelling or too big is the new camera control a game changer or a gimmick how well do the Apple intelligence features actually work if the iPhone 16 Pro Max has the best iPhone battery life ever how long does it lost after testing this flagship phone for several days I'd say that it is indeed a handful and while I am encouraged by some of the Apple intelligence features I tested in a beta that's arriving next month more AI capabilities will be coming later still the battery life from the iPhone 16 Pro Max is insane and the camera is predictably great so this is one of the best phones money can buy Apple clearly still has some catching up to do with AI and the design hasn't changed much with the exception of slightly Slimmer Basel but this is the new iPhone I'd buy with my money the ginner normous 6.9 in iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at $1,199 us with 256 GB of storage and goes on sale September 20 you can upgrade to 512 GB for $200 more and another $200 will get you 1 tab I have been a pro Max user for years since the iPhone 11 Pro Max but after testing the new iPhones I'm actually torn about the iPhone 16 Pro Max it has the largest display ever of any iPhone at 6.9 in yes the thinner bezels help keep the device somewhat compact but it is still taller wider and heavier than the iPhone 15 Pro Max which I thought was the near perfect size and weight for a big screen phone I have gone from feeling like I cheated the system to feeling slightly cheated this might be an unpopular opinion but I think the new Pro Max is a little too big at least for my hands it's more of a stretch now to do simple things like scrolling through web pages or Tik Tok and once you put a case on your iPhone 16 Pro Max it's like a mini tank the good news is that the pro Max is built to be more durable in addition to having a titanium band Apple claims that the improved ceramic Shield display on this model is 50% tougher than the last generation we can't drop these units but on paper it's encouraging the iPhone 16 Pro Max comes in four colors titanium white titanium black natural titanium and desert titanium our iPhone 16 Pro came in the natural which looks fairly modern but I prefer the desert color as it pops more the iPhone 16 pro and pro Max displays don't get any upgrades in terms of brightness or refresh rate but they are still among the best toet panels on a phone the only main difference is that the screen scan is scal down to a minimum of one NS which means you can use your phone in bed without disturbing anyone else and get an even dimer alarm clock otherwise the new iPhone 16 Pro Max screen is largely the same allowing the pixel 9 Pro to Surge ahead in terms of brightness we measured a Max of about, 1500 NES for the iPhone 16 Pro Max while the pixel9 pro XL hit more than 2300 needs outside inir sunlight the iPhone 16 pro and pro Max were both dier than the pixel9 pro XEL so Google's phone deed faster over time in response to the heat other than the displ size the biggest design change to the iPhone Pro Max is the addition of the camera control button this resist capacity button on the right side uses heptic to give you feedback and it launches you straight into the camera no more having to Fumble for the onscreen camera shortcut and you can now use the action button for another shortcut this thing is pretty easy to use in both portrait and and scap mode so what can you do with camera control a lot actually a quick press snaps a photo and a long press starts recording a video but I'm not a fan of the fact that the video stops when you take your finger off the button you can also slide your finger across the button to zoom in and out which is pretty smooth not as smooth is the double soft press which lances a sub menu of various options from tweaking the depth and exposure to toggling between multiple photographic Styles camera control works well but applying just the right amount of pressure and remembering what a single press and double press do takes practice I also wouldn't recommend taking macro shorts with the camera control as it shook the camera when I got super close to a subject the iPhone 16 Pro Max gets a bunch of camera upgrades starting with a new 48 map Fusion camera for the main shooter that's designed to read data Foster the result should be zero shutter lag and Foster Focus I took some shots of people passing by on scooters and moving texes at the same time on the iPhone 16 Pro Max and iPhone 15 Pro Max and the new iPhone was indeed faster the results were not necessarily sharer two as you can see in this side by side comparison here are some camera samples of iPhone 16 Pro Max what the iPhone 16 Pro Max's video gets an upgrade with 4K video capture up to 120 frames per second and there are some pretty neat things you can do with that footage using the playback speedol controls I could slow down a pingpong match to 50% 25% or 20% and the footage still looked sharp Apple intelligence is Apple's version of AI That's designed to be more secure and helpful than what Samsung and Google offer but right now Apple intelligence is more of a tease since it's in diabl beta right now and it won't launch for the rest of us until October even then certain features won't be available such as visual intelligence and GPT integration so what will you be able to do with the Apple intelligence starting in October it starts with a new Siri the assistant has been revamped starting with a redesigned that makes the whole outside of the display glow on someone and you can type to Siri now you can you are in a situation where you don't want to use your voice Siri is definitely more forgiving of screws up as you can correct yourself on the Fly and it will still get your common right I started a timer and changed the time mid sentence without a problem you can also ask follow-up questions and see will get for the context Apple intelligence also delivers a wide range of writing tools you can have the iPhone 16 Pro proof fre your copy of for grammar and word choice or get help rewriting if you want to go for say a more professional tone for example I put together a mock email demanding AR raise and I got something back that is much more appropriate you can also have apple intelligence summarized long passages of text as I did with a few notes I wish you didn't have to select all text first but I did get a fairly good summary of the key points for my short list of this video don't want to look up how to articles seral aages large language models and Apple support info to give you step-by-step instructions on how to do lots of stuffs on your iPhone from making screen recordings to scheduling a text this is a game changer for kids who play the IT person for their parents like me if you are looking for an apple intelligence feature that tugs at the heart strings try making a memory movie Just enter a key phrase as you prompt and specify the mood and you will see the iPhone 16 Pro Max create a movie out of thin air complete with music clean up in the photos app a way overdue feature compared to what you will find on the pixel and Galaxy but it is still nice to have you can remove unwanted objects or people in the frame with just a tap the cleanup feature worked fairly well when I try to remove a person from a selfie but you will get the best results if the background isn't too complicated the iPhone 16 Pro Max is indeed an iterative upgrade and maybe it wouldn't feel that way if Apple intelligence was available today along with all the promised features instead it's going to trickle out over time so I would not to be in a rush to upgrade having said that I think that iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best phone money can buy right now if you want the biggest screen and longest battery life it lags in Zoom versus the s24 ultra but you get more endurance better camera quality and plenty of creative features like photographic styles and audio mix I actually preferred the AI capabilities of the pixel 9 Pro Axel series with its smarter Jin live voice assistant and other features like ad me for photos and pixel screenshots but the pixel's performance and battery life Trail the iPhone 16 Pro Max for me the iPhone 16 Pro Max retains its title as the best phone but it's not because of Apple intelligence"
_3_ibMon2nU,iPhone 15 Pro Review - It&#39;s not a phone anymore..,iJustine,2023-09-19T13:05:02Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3_ibMon2nU,"- Here it is, the brand new
iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. (bright music) While everyone likes to joke that it's the same phone as
last year, you'd be wrong. Especially for photographers
and videographers, it is so hard to even call this a phone. With the introduction of
USB-C for fast data transfer, the new 5X Telephoto and ProRes Log, it just so happens that my
camera can make phone calls. (upbeat music) The camera of course is where
the new iPhone 15 Pro shines but also this new
titanium finish that comes in natural, black,
white, and blue titanium. I've got the new natural color right here and also the blue and
they are just so stunning like the way that they reflect
the light, so beautiful. The thing that is also
really surprising is how light they are compared
to the previous version. It's only a slight weight difference, but with these new rounded edges, it has an all new feel to it. Now if you have an Apple Watch Ultra, this new natural titanium
is a perfect match. Another huge design change
is it now finally has USB-C. The Pro models will support up to USB-C speeds that are 20 times faster than the regular iPhone 15. This is because of the all new A17 Pro chip
for enhanced performance. So they've now made an action
button on the iPhone 15 Pros. This used to be where
the silent switch was but now you can actually
customize this button to do basically whatever you want. You can still have it silence
your iPhone if you choose to, but you can select from focus modes, camera options, flashlights,
voice memo, magnifier. You can create custom
shortcuts, accessibility, or you can have it do nothing,
which is kind of pointless. I don't know why you
would even select that. I have mine set up to access the camera since that's pretty much
what I use my phone for. You can even use the action
button as a shutter button. The display has slightly thinner borders. Dynamic Island is back and ProMotion on the Pros give you a
super smooth animation. You can choose from the 6.1 inch or the 6.7 inch sizes, but the Max version is the only camera that has the 5X zoom. Now speaking of 5X zoom, this new tech in the
Telephoto is called Tetraprism and this uses a series
of mirrors to reflect and magnify to keep the
camera lens much smaller. That's one of the things
that we always joke about. Each year, the camera bumps
get larger and larger. So using this Tetraprism, this allows for you to keep the
camera bumps much smaller and they don't have to
be increased in size but yet we still get
that 5X magnification. (upbeat music) So here on Catalina,
there's this old casino and it's now turned into a museum and a dive shop and
we're up here on the hill and I'm gonna show you guys a little demo of the zoom that we have
on the new 15 Pro Max only. It'll go up to 5X, but the
main camera now also can act as three lenses, a 24, a
28, and a 35 millimeter. So when you click through on the 1X, you'll be able to see those
change just like this. My favorite demo though is going from the wide angle all
the way into the 5X. This really shows you the perspective that you're able to get. This is equivalent to 120
millimeter focal length, pretty far out dude. I took the new phones to Catalina to test them out diving. (soft music) (upbeat music) They are water and dust resistant up to six meters for 30 minutes. But I use this new Oceanic+ housing which will let you turn your
phone into a dive computer and also capture videos
and photos up to 196 feet. Now I have a full review on this housing in another
video, but it is so incredible. Now most of this video footage
that you're seeing here I shot in 4K 60 because this lets me slow down the footage and post
if I see a fast fishy or if I'm floating around
too fast in a current. Oceanic+ is the same app
that was launched last year with the Apple Watch Ultra to
let you turn your Apple Watch into a dive computer. So it is so cool that you can
now do this with your iPhone. (soft music) I love testing out taking photos and videos all around Catalina. My favorite thing we shot
though was this Wes Anderson's To Health TikTok meme
video using the ProRes Log. And I'm so happy with how it turned out. Behind the scenes of our Wes Anderson
TikTok vertical content. (soft music) (soft music) (soft music) (food crunches) (golf cart starts) (soft music) (soft music) Shooting in Log is really cool because it gives you so much
more flexibility in editing with color and it also
can save some highlights if it's a super bright day. So let's test them out
and see what we got. (upbeat music) I also didn't realize that you can shoot in ProRes on the front facing camera. So right now, shooting
ProRes, front facing camera. Now the thing with ProRes
though is it is going to increase your file sizes, which is one of the reasons why this feature
is specifically on the Pros. Now if I want to shoot in 4K 60, this is where a little
notification pops up and it says ProRes not supported, but it will be supported when
recording to external storage. Now I'm gonna try recording externally to this little OWC drive,
this is one terabyte. So we're gonna switch this into the ProRes Log and
to 60 frames a second, plug it in, and it's time to record. (upbeat music) I was also super impressed with how well it shot videos at night. Here's the demo of a shot that was shot in Log and here is one that's just regular and you can kind of
see here in the lights, how it's saved a little more detail and it's less blown out around the lights. Night Mode also got a
little boost as well. So here's a few photos that
I took handheld on the 15. You can see all of the detail here, especially in the 5X zoom,
it's pretty impressive. This is a difficult shot 'cause
there's like a lot of light. There's also not a lot of light. (warm music) (warm music) So testing out the new
iPhone 15 Pro camera system because it is newer and it is
the latest and the greatest. It's the best iPhone
that Apple has ever made. I like to kind of test
them out in comparison to the previous version. Let's see if we can tell the difference. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) We're gonna get ice cream. This is how you properly
do an iPhone review. (upbeat music) There's a few new pro options now that you can quickly access
here in the top menu. Now you do need to first turn
these on in the settings. Now when you're in the
camera, you can press to hold and quickly switch between
the options as needed. I shot most of my photos just
in normal mode and in RAW max. The HEIF mode will give you
a higher resolution image at a much smaller file size, But since I have the one terabyte phone, I just shot in the Pro Max resolution for most of my photos when I
wasn't shooting in the normal. It's golf cart time,
this is my favorite part about Catalina is running a golf cart and going and exploring the island. (upbeat music) Now Action Mode isn't something new but it's still so impressive. You can also see in this
demo here that we're on a super bouncy golf cart and it's able to really stabilize that
footage so much better and it made it super smooth. These were also shot in Log, so here's what it looks
like before the color and here's what it looks like after. I'm not gonna lie, I don't
really shoot that much in Cinematic Mode normally, but when I do, I'm always so impressed
with how great it looks. So now Cinematic Mode
supports digital zoom from 1X to 3X, so you can tap one or two and then you can use the scroll wheel to go all the way up to three. Now in regular video
you can do this as well but all the way up to 15. Something else I noticed
is how smooth the zoom is. So when you're using the scroll wheel, you can really fine tune
your zoom and get as close or as far away from your
subject as you like. (warm music) I love being able to go in
and edit in Cinematic Mode. So when you're in here,
as you tap on something on the screen as you're playing the video, it'll change the focus
from whichever point of interest that you want it to focus on. So as you'll see here, I've tapped on my face and then I've tapped back here on the background and now
it's focusing not on me, it's focusing more in the background. And as you continue
through on this timeline, this gives you the ability to
reshoot what you already shot. It's also great because if
you do bring a cinematic clip into Final Cut, you can do the same action and change the focal point there as well. (warm music) Obviously for me, testing out photos and video is my favorite thing, but a few of the other updates is
the new wireless tech. With the new second gen
Ultra Wideband chip, this enables precision
finding for friends. Now, this is of course only if
your friend wants to be found but when you turn this on,
it'll give you precise turn by turn directions of
getting to your friend, much like when you're
trying to find your AirPods. So I love gaming and they
are really turning this phone into a console level gaming device. With the new A7 pro chip, this is giving performance
improvements for games like mesh shading and hardware
accelerated ray tracing. I also really like that
I can charge my AirPods or Apple Watch using the charge
port and since it's USB-C, this is a great time to pick yourself up a nice
pink iJustine USB-C cable to go with it, pinkijustinecables.com,
shameless plug. Roadside assistance has also been added to the satellite emergency
offering using AAA, which I actually have
AAA, so hyped about that. This is pretty great if you
get a flat tire or you break down and you need help,
I've definitely been there. So it is nice to know that
you can use the satellite for more than just a
super emergency situation. So all in all, I have been
loving the new phone and of course if you do already
have an iPhone 14 Pro device, this isn't gonna be like some huge, massive overhaul physically, but if you are super into video, the new zoom and the ability
to shoot in Log is so awesome. I love the new titanium
finish and how light it is. It just feels so nice in your hand. It's fast, with all of
the added iOS 17 features, it definitely does feel
like a really great upgrade. I have a bunch of other Apple videos here if you wanna check them out after this. Thank you guys for
watching and let me know what your favorite color
iPhone is this season."
To54FvXT5m0,iPhone 15 Pro HONEST review - 8 Months of DISAPPOINTMENT?,Jon Adams ,2024-05-24T12:31:11Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To54FvXT5m0,"the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max came out eight months ago that's a long time to figure out if a phone is going to be great quality or not so let's talk about this was the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max worth it now one of the biggest things that was hyped up when the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max came out was the titanium case as you can see on this case it is absolutely gorgeous this metal housing it is natural titanium now they did come out with multiple colors of this titanium but if you ask me the natural titanium was the best looking color of them all now I don't know who out there needs to hear this but when you buy something so expensive like an iPhone you need to put a case on it I know a lot of people say they don't like cases on their phone but when you invest this much money into a phone I do think it's necessary to protect it yes you can get apple care but that is just so frustrating to get apple to fix your phone and this natural titanium it does scratch so the fact that I put a case on my phone for these last8 months means that my phone has zero scratches right now which is important because once we get to the pricing you'll realize you can sell these phones and upgrade and if it's in pristine condition that is a big deal so the natural titanium it looks fantastic um is holding up really well next let's talk about the screen on these iPhones they have the promotion display because it is a pro model the promotion display is gorgeous whenever you're swiping on something like a book it looks absolutely gorgeous it's very very smooth and it's just nice to have a display that's not choppy when you're moving back and forth the iPhone 15 Pro is a 6.1 in display where the iPhone Max is a 6.7 in display and they're both super retina displays which means they have a 460 pixel per inch that just means it's really really sharp when you're looking at text on this phone it is extremely sharp that's one of my problems with some of the older iPads when you're looking at the text on these things it's just not as sharp but this super Retina Display it is absolutely gorgeous next when you're talking about the screen you do have to talk about the dynamic Island now I've actually found the dynamic Island extremely helpful when I'm cooking or something like that I actually see the dynamic Island even if I'm watching something I love having that Dynamic Island there just to help out it also helps when you're driving it shows you kind of where your next turn is all that so I really really enjoy having that Dynamic Island I know a lot of people are frustrated there's kind of this pill-shaped thing in the middle of the screen it does not bother me at all like as you're looking at it I mean after like the first day I do not notice that Dynamic Island in any way so for those who are holding off buying this phone because it has a notch or it has this kind of pill-shaped thing that is not a reason to hold off you will not notice it next let's talk about the button layout on this phone you have two volume rockers and you have this action button on the side I can tell you this the action button I thought it was going to be a cool idea however I just don't really use it right now I have it set to set my phone on silent mode and that's cool but like I'm just not really going to use that because the reality is I have my phone on silence all the time I don't understand people that turn on their notifications or their ringer and all that and like you're in the middle of a crowd of people and all of a sudden it goes off I don't like to be noticed in that way and so for me I keep my phone on silence as much as possible and honestly I'd probably love to move to having my phone with all notifications turned off because I just hate the fact that I can put my my phone in my pocket and I feel these like Phantom buzzes all the time I'd rather just check it when I need to check it and not be worried that I'm missing notifications and all that so the action button you can set it to do some cool things I know people have used the shortcuts app to do stuff I have it on silence and I just don't use it hey real quick I want to thank today's sponsor magb for sponsoring portion of today's video now if you're anything like me you don't lose your stuff often I don't I don't lose my keys I don't lose my phone but what I do lose sometimes is my wallet the reason being is I have air tags on most of my stuff except my wallet because the air tag is too chunky that's where magb back comes in for me this is the magb back wallet it is made out of great leather you can hold multiple cards in it and the best thing of all is that it's mag safe compatible and so you just stick it on your phone it is very well done the magnets on this thing are super strong like I would never in my life be able to shake this thing off I've paired it with the case for the iPhone 15 Pro and one thing I love about this is that it has a loop on the back for your finger so you can use it and hold your phone and know that you're not going to drop it and I also just love how satisfying this is like hear this that's how you know the magnets are super tight on this thing now talking about the case I have had this on my phone for a whole month if you go back on multiple of my videos you will see this case on it it is a fantastic quality Case I've dropped my phone numerous times and it is not cracked as you can see on the edges it's got more padding up here on the corners of the phone because when you drop your phone the most likely thing is that you're going to drop it on a corner and that's where phones break and so this case has been beautiful but like I said earlier in the video I love the natural titanium of this phone and so for me when I have the 10an wallet on my natural titanium case and it's clear I can still see through it and see the beautiful phone so I am super impressed with the magb back wallet and the iPhone 15 Pro case go ahead and click the link in the description below and use the code John Adams 15 at checkout to get 15% off thank you again magb back for sponsoring today's video let's get back into it next let's talk about the cameras on this phone there are three separate cameras however one of the cameras can do multiple focal lengths so when you're in the cameras app you can hit the focal lengths button if you can see the screen it does zoom in I don't think it's I mean obviously it's not actual focal lengths that are different it's just zooming in a little bit on the image which you can just pinch and zoom next let's talk about the number one feature why anybody would switch to the iPhone 15 Pro or the 15 Pro Max and that is this right here the USBC Port it is fantastic that Apple was made to make sure that they had USBC on their iPhones for me this is my favorite feature by far of the new iPhone the fact that it has USBC so now when I'm traveling no matter where I go I always have one cable with me that I know for a fact can charge my devices and it does seem like apple is in the process of phasing out lightning ports on all their stuff and so having USBC to charge like everything absolutely everything is awesome I actually I thought it was going to be cool that the uh MacBook Pros got the new mag Safe Port back but because I like to travel with one cable I like everything on USBC so even on my MacBook I'm not charging it with the mag safe I'm charging it with USBC now storage capacities on these devices it's pretty solid it starts off at 128 gigs and I've got a little screen right here so I don't get anything wrong then it moves up to 256 512 and 1 TB that is for the 15 Pro but the pro Max actually starts at 256 and goes all the way up to 1 Tab and so if you're really somebody who really needs the storage U maybe go with the pro Max but for me what I don't love and back to the kind of display discussion what I don't love is something in my pocket that is just absolutely enormous and what I don't like about the iPhone 15 Pro Max is it feels like you have this huge thing that's causing heat in your pocket all the time I don't like that that I want the smallest phone possible Apple got rid of the Mini phone and that's an absolute travesty but this is a beautiful size phone it's nice skinny and thin um and so I don't really notice it in my pocket all that much but when I've had Max devices in my pocket it's just too much with my phone my wallet my conceal carry all that stuff next let's talk about the a77 bionic that is inside this phone it's fantastic I have never once with my phone felt like it was not powerful enough like so far there has been nothing not a single time where been using this phone and I thought to myself man I just wish I had a little bit more power but what's interesting is even though it's super powerful what I love is that it doesn't killed the battery life when I'm using this phone I have battery life for at least a day by the time I get into my bed I still have about 30% of a charge left and so the battery life on this is spectacular apple on their website says that when you're watching video you can get up to 23 hours of playback on it I don't know how true that is and especially over time as you charge a phone over and over the battery life actually increases but what I can tell you is that you can get at least one full day while using your phone pretty significantly and you're just fine and in my house I have wireless chargers everywhere so even if my phone does dip a little bit low I just set it down on a wireless charger it has mag safe and so it charges it pretty fast with 15 watts it does take a while but again I don't need it to go all the way to 100 I just need it to get to like 50% and I'm good and hey if you want to buy this wallpaper go ahead and check my digital store it'll be linked below it's only a dollar for you but it really does help me out next let's talk about the pricing of these the 15 Pro starts at $1,000 the pro Max starts at $1,300 that is a lot of money however I use this device constantly every day which might not be great for my mental health but that is true like when I'm talking about a camera I use my phone especially when I'm looking at my kids and I kind of want to keep memories and stuff when I'm talking about notes I'm not going out and buying a bunch of different notebooks I keep everything on my phone this is also my music player so for me when I'm looking at that kind of price it is not outrageous to think that something with this much versatility would cost that price personally because you use your phone all day every day I think it's actually worth it to put the money in to make sure you get the device that you want so who should upgrade to this phone I think people who are on maybe the 11 or the 12 should upgrade I did do a video about the 13 Pro Max versus the 15 Pro Max it's not that big of a difference so if you're on a a 13 Pro and you're still liking it it's not slowing down stay on that wait for the 16 to come out but if you're earlier than that your phone is slowing down or you're like me and you're just a Tech head go ahead and upgrade it is a fantastic phone I highly recommend it it's beautiful the display is amazing the cameras are great I don't think if you upgrade you're going to be disappointed but if you want to check out that video on the 13 Pro Max versus the 15 Pro Max go ahead and check this video out right here I'll see you on the next one"
7Ql6TLeLRP8,iPhone 15 Pro Review,IGN,2023-09-20T19:44:23Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ql6TLeLRP8,foreign it's difficult to get excited about the latest iPhone when it rarely looks markedly different from previous models and the benefits of upgrading annually aren't as noticeable compared to the big jump you get if you wait a few years this year that's different though thanks mainly to the addition of one prominent feature USBC yes the exact same USBC that Android phones have been using since 2015. it's an example of Apple finally getting out of its own way and letting the iPhone play nicely with pretty much every other device and charger you could want to use it with and it's one of the most liberating decisions the company has ever made the iPhone 14 pro did not get a radical design change from the iPhone 13 Pro which in turn was not dramatically different from the iPhone 12 Pro likewise the iPhone 15 Pro could be mistaken for any of its recent predecessors if you didn't look too closely taking the new iPhone out in a crowd during our review period netted not a single curious eye and that lack of Dazzle will be exacerbated once you throw a case on it and cover up nearly every noticeable difference yeah it's a bummer using a case which anyone in their right mind should is kind of sad because the new titanium chassis on the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max is really nice the iPhone 14 pro has glossy steel sides that love to collect fingerprints but the new titanium size and the iPhone 15 Pro resist them beautifully the back features this sort of frosted glass that also resists fingerprints well hides any scratches that might appear and just feels really nice in the hand it's smooth without being slippery Apple also managed to reduce the size and weight of both the pro and pro Max without shrinking their 6.1 and 6.7 OLED screens respectively both reductions are minor millimeters smaller and a scant few grams lighter but hey we'll take it the only downside here is that just like nearly every year the differences are just great enough that you'll need to get a new case all right not only is the camera module slightly different the physical size reduction is going to force the issue both dynamically adjust up to 120 hertz with Apple's Pro mode version have P3 wide color support haptic touch and both HDR and Apple's true tone all that is pretty much the same as the iPhone 14 pro but the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max get almost twice as bright at up to 2 000 nits of peak brightness that is bright show yourself the dynamic Island introduced in the iPhone 14 pro makes a return as does the always-on display though you can turn it off if you want if anything about the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max's exterior design could be called radical it would be the decision to do away with a switch on the side that since the very first iPhone has toggled between ring and Silent slash vibrate only mode and replaced it with what Apple calls the action button Dynamic while you can make that button do exactly what the previous switch did it can also be assigned to a range of alternate tasks uh open the camera or go straight to video mode record a voice memo turn on the flashlight or even a shortcut of whatever you're choosing it seems minor but it's really a nice quality of life Edition it's time to talk about the best new feature on the iPhone it finally finally uses USBC goodbye lightning connector see you at hell I can't believe we were stuck with this limited slow cable since the iPhone 5 debuted 11 years ago it cannot be overstated how big of a quality of life Improvement this one upgrade is instead of having two cables on your desk one to charge your PS5 controller and one to charge your iPhone you can now have one and it's significantly reduces the number of cables you need to carry when you travel one caveat though while the iPhone 15 Pro and Promax have USBC they don't have what most people would describe as fast charging Apple says the Promax is able to give you up to a 50 charge in 35 minutes with a 20 watt adapter or higher which by the way not included with your phone the pro gets 50 charge in 30 minutes with the same adapter that's decently fast but not as fast as many might expect if they were coming from an Android device just because it has USBC support doesn't mean it's your only option Apple again brings back magsafe which was introduced in the iPhone 12 for wireless charging at 15 watts key is 7.5 watts and it supports a number of peripherals including a Belkin stand that will charge it and turn it into a bedside or desktop clock one dock a nice little melding of hardware and software appreciate that one last feature to mention is the iPhone 15 pro has voice isolation capability for calls so does easier for the person you're calling to hear you if you're in a loud area it works reasonably well and is nice to have when you're trying to have a conversation while washing dishes or while at a busy Market Apple spent a good bit of the iPhone 15 reveal event talking about the 15 Pros gaming chops even going so far as to promise that its new a17 Pro chip would bring AAA games like Resident Evil Village and Assassin's Creed Mirage we're talking the full games here not trim down mobile versions to run natively on iPhone 15 Pro with enough power left over to enable Ray tracing lighting effects not bad while we weren't able to push the iPhone 15 Pro or Promax to their limits during our review period since none of the games Apple highlighted were actually available yet our reviewer was able to play both honkai star Rail and genshin impact and both ran extremely well with visual settings and frame rates cranked to the max any dropped frames or graphical glitches despite maximum settings which is a notable improvement over last year's iPhone 14 pro which chugs even in the menu Apple's OLED display also shines here battery life while gaming is good but not exceptional after just a few minutes playing honkai Star rail the phone was down five percent we estimated it was pulling about one percent of battery life for every minute and a half to two minutes which is a pretty fast drain and would amount to around an hour and a half to two hours of intensive play without having to plug it back in apple says the iPhone 15 Pro can last for up to 20 hours of streamed video content while the pro Max can go for 25 hours which is pretty close to what Samsung promises with its s23 Ultra but games are far more energy intensive and will burn through the battery even faster for the first time in a few years only the iPhone 15 Pro Max gets the best camera Apple could offer but that difference is reserved for the level of optical telephoto zoom while the sensor behind that lens Remains the Same as last year Apple put a new 120 millimeter tetraprism lens in front of it that gives you nearly double the optical zoom you'll get out of the iPhone 14 pro and iPhone 15 Pro the quality of the images out of its 12 megapixel camera is pretty much as expected you can just see from farther away the main camera on both phones is improved by its ability to shoot 24 megapixel photos instead of last year's 12 just like last year it is possible to shoot with the full 48 megapixel resolution that the sensor captures but you do sacrifice dynamic range in order to get that additional resolution the resolution bump to 24 megapixels without sacrificing dynamic range in the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro gets a big thumbs up especially if you're a photographer to be frank most users won't find themselves using smartphone photos in a way where 24 megapixels is going to change their lives but anyone who plans to edit and otherwise publish these photos is nearly always going to be happy with a higher resolution if nothing else it lets you crop in more without losing details Apple has also made portrait mode engage by default if the camera senses a person or animal in the frame it automatically captures a depth map that will allow you to add the depth effect later should you want it that depth map also allows you to change the focus point between two subjects in post-production should you desire and I think that is pretty damn cool the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max can also record up to 4K at 60p but not out of the box this is a feature that has been added thanks specifically to the speed provided by the aforementioned USBC Port while all other resolutions and frame rates are available to record directly to the iPhone's internal storage 4K at 60p requires an attached SSD the good news is that all photos and videos can easily be transferred to and from that external drive at USB 3.0 speeds which is a massive Improvement to workflow over previous iPhones which either required the pitifully slow lightning connection or the somewhat faster airdrop provided where you're trying to send it is also an Apple device now data management is far faster and more platform agnostic Apple's annual smartphone refreshes have felt especially incremental since the iPhone x and at first blush that appears to have happened again with the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max their attractive titanium edges and useful customizable action button are fairly subtle to the eye and the first things to get covered up by a case of course that is however deceptive Apple has changed quite a bit internally to make this year's phone its most compelling upgrade since the iPhone 11. especially if you're passionate about photography or video while the universal compatibility and transfer speeds of USBC are a Headline Edition the upgraded gaming ready processor better camera software and titanium chassis are all notable

EeTs67l69B4,iPhone 15 Pro - Top 5 Features🔥,SuperSaf,2023-09-13T16:44:38Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeTs67l69B4,here are 5 new things about the iPhone 15 Pro one it finally has a USB type-c port we can save farewell to the lightning Port once and for all USBC is much faster and it's Universal and it's already on many other Apple products like the MacBooks and the iPads two it has a titanium build this makes it more durable but also lighter so even though it's around the same size as the 14 pro it weighs almost 20 grams or less 3. it's powered by the new a17 Pro chip this is the first three nanometer chip on a smartphone and will mean improved GPU and CPU performance as well as better Ray tracing in games 4. it has a new 48 megapixel camera with improved low light and better portrait mode the 15 Pro Max also gets five times telephoto zoom and 5. it has a customizable action button you can press and hold this to switch to silent mode open the camera or pretty much whatever you set it to follow for more iPhone 15 content
Ipp4NqtL12U,"Son, I am disappoint. - iPhone 15 Pro",ShortCircuit,2023-10-03T22:40:20Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipp4NqtL12U,"No, no, no, no, no. After being one of the first iPhones to excite me in years, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are absolutely mired in controversy right now. Everything from overheating to Apple providing weird advice regarding charging cables to even a new bend gate. But that doesn't mean that I don't still wanna check them out. So let's take a look at not just the phones, but also this fun little report card that the Labs team put together for me. Right out of the gate, boy, are they ever pretty. And the beauty is more than just skin deep. They feature an aluminum-titanium hybrid frame. We'll get into that a little bit more later. A 6.7 or 6.1 inch display, depending on whether you go for the Pro or the Pro Max. Apple's new A17 Pro, no longer bionic, chipset featuring two performance cores, four efficiency cores, and six GPU cores, along with eight gigs of LPDDR5 memory and all the wireless fixings, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, and their ultra wideband chip that has some cool new tricks up its sleeve, like the ability to find your friends, just like you can find an Apple AirTag in a crowd of people. That is legitimately pretty useful if you have friends. Of course, for the folks whose best friends are their dogs or their cars, there's the cameras. Each has a 48 megapixel main shooter, along with two 12 megapixel auxiliary shooters, one ultra wide and one telephoto. That telephoto is 5X optical zoom on the Pro Max and 3X on the regular Pro. For the avid photographers, I could see that being enough, especially when you combine that with some of the new software enabled capabilities, like the ability to record log raw footage, even to an external storage device via the all new 10 gigabit per second USB-C port, the ability to take a regular photo, and then convert it to portrait after the fact, so you don't have to make the decision at the time, and the ability to record spatial video for viewing on the upcoming Apple Vision Pro headset. There's, of course, some other physical things. In addition to that USB-C port, we get our usual volume buttons, and, okay, I'm legitimately so excited about this, and it should just be on everything the action button. Gone is the toggle switch for vibrate in ring mode, and here is the action button. Just click it to see what mode you're in, and hold it if you wanna switch between ring and silent. Or if you're not into that, you can reconfigure it to just about anything you want. I have no idea how to do this. Let's see how quickly I can figure it out. It's not here for some reason, although that would be fairly obvious to me. Nope, I guess we need to dig into the old fashioned settings app. All right, well, that wasn't that hard to find. Ooh, configurability. Choose a shortcut. This is so much more robust already than what I've seen with things like the stupid Bixby button that Samsung made extremely difficult when they first introduced it to just do whatever the crap I want with it. Okay, this is an example. Even things like the double press the lock button to open the camera functionality that's on some Android phones. The lack of configurability for that kind of thing. This puts it to shame. No recognized music, man. Can you configure it though to use it in different ways? Press, hold, double press, that would be next level. Oh, accessibility features. In some cases, that's just Apple's way of saying features that you wanted, but we won't admit are a good idea. Like the mouse support that they added on the iPad as an accessibility feature forever. And then we're like, okay, fine, it's a good idea. Quick camera launching on the iPhone, yes. Look, I know from the lock screen, I know you can do this, I know. Okay, watch this, watch this, watch, okay, quick draw. I press the action button, oh, camera's open already. I'm ready, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap. Oh, I like it. I gotta be honest with you guys. So far, I still kind of love it. It's amazing how used to giant phones I've gotten though the Pro Max doesn't even feel unreasonably big. I think this is probably the route I'd go. Though for gamers, that might not actually be the best option. You see, both of them have the same 460 PPI pixel density. Both of them will run it anywhere from 10 to 120 Hertz with adaptive refresh rate technology. So they'll feel smooth when they need to feel smooth and can save power when they need to save power. But because the size of the screen of the Pro Max is so much greater, we actually found in our game testing that our 1% lows were significantly lower. Meaning that in periods of intense action, you could experience significantly lower dips, which could result in you getting killed. I mean, not in real life in the game, but you get the point, right? The brightness of these screens is flipping outstanding. Okay, in SDR, we got 250 nits full screen in a dark room, a thousand nits outdoors. And in an 18% window, we got 2200 nits in SDR. 2200 nits on a phone? Are you flipping kidding me? In HDR, we didn't see the same kinds of stratospheric highs, but these are really, really impressive displays. For me, the gaming story of the iPhone 15 family though, is not mobile games like this. It's the AAA games that they were showing off during the announcement. If we actually get developers porting their games to metal for the iPhone, it could be a literal game changer. Since I've been gaming for so long, now seems like as good a time as I need to talk about the first big controversy, thermals. While we didn't extensively test for thermals, we did perform game benchmarking, so we did make some observations. Our devices got as high as 43 degrees on the surface, which is not particularly comfortable, but isn't going to do any kind of harm, while we've seen reports of as high as 46. Our best guess is that it's one of a couple of things. Either those other outlets were charging while performing their testing, and therefore adding some additional thermal load to the device, or there could be some variance, depending on whether these phones were made in China, where the factories have more experience, or made in India. So here's a fun little thing you can do. If you look at the box, you will see blah, blah, blah, assembled in China, something, something, yes, right there. But if you look inside the USB-C port, there's a little engraving that indicates if you got a China or an India unit. So one of our theories, and this may impact some of the other controversies as well, is that there could be some slight differences, whether they're at the factory, or whether they're up the supply chain that are causing these phones to be slightly different. So my iPhone 15 Pro Max that I ordered on launch day is China. Our iPhone 15, which the team has already checked, is a China model. And my iPhone 15 Pro is also China. So I wonder if there's a little bit better consistency in these China models. Like you can just immediately tell. Shot on iPhone looks better. Sorry, Android. Really, I'm one of your people, but gotta give credit where it's due. Now let's talk about the second big controversy, fragility. Apple spent a fair bit of time talking about, the titanium frame, and that sounds really impressive. But in Zach from JerryRigEverything's bend test, he actually found that it failed extremely quickly. I mean, it's not the kind of thing that I think will just happen sitting in your pocket, like we saw with, what was it, the iPhone 6, I think. It should be noted that for Zach, the regular Pro, the non-Max, didn't have any noticeable bending problems. Another thing that happened was Apple Track had the camera bump break off during a drop test. Labs' theory is that the camera module could be introducing a weak point due to the way that the glass curves up from the main body or the flex in the subframe that pushes against the inside of the glass during a drop. The break in the glass is perfectly aligned with the inner frame. Enough about controversy, let's talk good things for a little bit. Both of these managed to achieve 85% charge in just an hour, and that's in spite of the fact that Apple does not support wildly fast charging rates, you know, 60 watts, 100 and plus watts or whatever else like some Android manufacturers do, and they both reached 100% in just over an hour and a half. By contrast, the iPhone 15 non-Pro took over two hours to reach 100%, but it should be noted, also reaches 85% in one hour. So it seems to be just down to the curve that Apple has chosen for topping up the last 15% of the battery. Another good thing, the USB-C port. They've actually given me a little bucket of fun things to attach to the new iPhones. Let's start with a microphone. Wait, did I even mention that dbrand sponsored this video yet? There's no broken glass this time, right? Nope, no broken glass, just iPhone cases. We've all seen cases like this in the past. They start out clear, they end up yellow, junk. dbrand's new ghost case is designed to never yellow. Wow, never is a really big word. Did they use the word never? dbrand seems quite confident they have engineered the case to solve that problem. So much so, in fact, that dbrand is offering free replacements in the event that your ghost case ever turns yellow. This looks absolutely sick. Considering all the torture that they've put me through over the years, I'm kind of hoping they do turn yellow and cause a huge headache. That must be from our sponsorship team. Yeah, pretty much. No, I don't hope they turn yellow because I actually believe in dbrand's approach to product design. I think that they overall do a pretty darn fine job and I'm really excited to no longer see ugly yellow plastic phone cases because when that happens, people inevitably throw them away and we end up just producing more garbage. It's better to produce some plastic thing once rather than over and over again. And this looks freaking awesome. So I'll be keeping this on the phone while we test out all these cool USB-C peripherals. What do you think are the odds this microphone's just gonna work? I don't think so. There's no way. No. No! Holy crap, it just worked. It just worked. Volume control just working? Is that just the headphone volume control? That's wild. You could just plug this into your iPhone and be recording audio. Oh, oh, we definitely need a Razer Viper 8K gaming mouse though. Does iOS support a mouse? I know iPad OS does, which is a totally different thing. Okay. Oh, no way! I'm a keyboard mouse gamer, folks. What if I lock it in? All right, because Apple arbitrarily decides that, well, iPads need to be locked in landscape mode. iPhones simply don't. What if I do? Apple is apparently warning that using third-party USB-C cables could cause damage to the device. My understanding the last time I looked at this is it was only a handful of stores in China and I don't even know if they were official Apple stores, but there apparently is some validity to it. There's a slightly smaller gap between the single row nine pin and single row 11 pin connectors. Realistically, the same is probably true of anytime you're using a third-party cable. Apple does apparently have a fuse and an identifier chip in their cable to make sure that it's an authentic cable. I mean, that's sort of not the point of USB-C. The point is that we can kind of use any cable we want. As you can see, I'm not having any trouble with it, but who knows, they may reject your warranty claim if you do not use an approved cable, but hey, at least you're getting pretty decent screen on time. We weren't able to get anywhere near the 23 and 29 hours that they advertise for YouTube playback on the regular Pro and the Pro Max respectively, but we did get 17.75 hours and 21 and a half hours, which is pretty darn respectable, and that was at 200 nits. We don't know exactly what Apple's test conditions were. It's possible, for example, that they had cellular turned off or they had the screen at minimum brightness. We're not sure, but those are still very respectable results, and in our stress tests, we saw 3.3 hours. This is running 3DMark Wildlife Extreme on the Pro and four hours on the Pro Max. Those are very respectable results. I wanna hook up a monitor. No, I wanna do what Framework did. This is so cool. They were memeing on their social media, all like, hey, Apple, way ahead of you. We got your USB Type-A adapter. Oh, of course, it's not compatible with the dbrand case. Oh, okay, sorry, dbrand. Love you guys. Go to shortlinus.com to go check it out and get your own ghost case, but for now, we're gonna have to lose it. Let's go ahead and pop this bad boy in. Woo, Type-A port, anyone? Ah, ah. They also showed adding the headphone jack back with their headphone jack module. Of course, that's not what I'm interested in right now. I'm just gonna pop out my laptop's HDMI port and plug that in. How cool is that? HDMI iPhone. HDMI phone? I have no idea what this monitor is. It's an LG something, but I don't know what resolution or what refresh rate it runs at, but what we're about to find out is if the iPhone supports it. Hey, look at that. We got the Chotek USB-C to HDMI cable. Okay, well, sorry, Framework. Investment disclosure. I mean, well, it's not the most elegant thing ever. Ow, you ready, you ready? I think we got this. Hey, even just for doing reviews of iPhones back in the day, I would have given my left testicle for this easy, seamless, flawless freaking screen capture. Just plug this bad boy into a capture card and you are good to freaking go. How did they not go USB-C sooner? This is awesome. I mean, we know why they didn't. So they could collect their licensing and certification fees for the lightning cable, but for the user, how did they not do this sooner? The best part is that it's super mature because iOS and iPadOS, let's face it, not that different. And a lot of this stuff has been awesome in iPadOS for a long time. That's one of the killers for me. It's just like how ahead of the game Apple was on USB-C and then how far behind the iPhone was on it. Not gonna lie, definitely some upscaling going on here that is more noticeable in the larger display, but that looks not bad. Oh, what the hell? So if you touch it, it shows. If you're interacting with it, you can see that. Interesting. Yep, that's rendered on an iPhone, all right. And this video is rendered out. Subscribe to Short Circuit.

1aRIQWinZHc,iPhone 15 / 15 Pro Hands on!,Mrwhosetheboss,2023-09-13T05:07:12Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aRIQWinZHc,"this is the iPhone 15 15 plus 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max I've flown all the way to Apple Park in California where I've gone Hands-On with the phones while also sitting down with some of Apple's major Executives so that I can give you everything you need to know the things I like and the things I don't like so let's start with the bass 15 and 15 plus which have had three minor changes and three major ones from last year the first being the design the iPhone 15's come in a whole Suite of past colors which are all pretty inoffensive I mean no one's going to hate them but me personally I strongly prefer just proper vibr confident colors as opposed to all this washed out off-white hoopla I remember seeing some rumors that there was going to be like a hot pink and a bubblegum blue and honestly that would have been awesome but what I am really glad about is the softer edges and the matte frosted finish on the back it may not be as cool as the very literal edginess on the last year's iPhones but I would take comfort any day you pick these phones up and instantly you notice this is like 200% more comfortable than the last phones and then the other minor but still very definitive Improvement is dynamic Island last year we got it on the pro iPhones now we've got it on every iPhone and it doesn't fundamentally change the way you use your phone but I would say it's a combination of both a nicer aesthetic than the notch it just feels more futuristic and less like your phone's got a fringe they're the same picture with just a Sprinkle of nice to have features things like when you start a timer you can see the progress of that timer how when you order an Uber it'll tell you how many minutes till that Uber arrives funnny enough on my flight on the way here it was telling me the whole journey how much longer I had left to Landing time which is actually really convenient and the other perk of it is that it persists even when you move to other apps and so even though this Dynamic Island it isn't physically creating any new screen space it's the way that Apple has made the software around it that almost makes it behave like a secondary sub display within your main display that lets you do two things at once also the display itself is even brighter at up to 1,600 nits or 2,000 nits if you're in direct sunlight if you haven't already used a 2,000 display it's pretty staggering like it will not just be readable in broad daylight but actually bright there's Ultra wideband chip wideband being one of the ways that your iPhone communicates with your other Apple gadgets so the better chip basically means you can find your lost goods from further away and also your lost friends in case you're really bad at directions and it looks like the 15s are also getting a lot of the big camera upgrades of last year's top end phones this is the first big change you know how Apple's used a 12 megap resolution main sensor for almost a decade now well it's gone in place of a bigger 48 megapix sensor and thank goodness for that because yeah I mean Apple did squeeze quite a lot out of the 12 megap sensor they had but it's only so far you can go and so with each of the last few Generations we've really felt the pro iPhone stepping up and then the regular iPhones scraping together some very minor software improvements but clearly restrained by the limits of this weaker Hardware so it's nice to see that limitation being lifted and also this 48 megapixel sensor has the side perk of letting you take two time zoom shots with far less of a quality hit than if we still on the 12 megapixel sensor and it means that in a lot of ways these base iPhone 15s are kind of like repack pack AG discounted versions of last year's 14 pros and that's not a bad thing if in one year what was previously Pro can become mainstream then that's progress and it does make this definitely feel like a bigger jump than what we saw last year between the 13 and the 14 although you are missing one key thing in the ultra fluid 120 HZ displays that the pros get these phones still have a standard 60 HZ rebrush rate which feels slow to me because 120 HZ is what I'm used to but it may not bother you at all if that's what you're used to one more thing though and this is something I never really thought I wanted but now that I've seen it this is nearly as big of a deal to me as the actual camera upgrade itself when you shoot a photo with the 15 now your phone can capture depth information automatically which means you don't need to sit there and think what mode should I be in right now you just take the shot which means you can take the shot quicker and every single shot has the perk that afterwards you can go through and make it a portrait and even switch between the different focal points within that shot now I would guess that the reason they've not done this sooner is that to do this your phone's got to capture a lot more information when it takes that photo and so it should take the phone longer and that would introduce some potential shutter lag and therefore blur in your shot this is going to need more testing on my end to see if Apple's managed to do it with no extra delay but that is what they're claiming but now it's time we talk about the elephant in the room the thing that the entire industry has been talking about for the last 6 months Apple has shifted from a lightning connector to a USBC or in other words they've shifted from a custom Apple made connector to the industry standard now it's not a secret that a big part of this is just Apple trying to get ahead of new EU rules would state that by 2024 all new smartphones need to be USBC to cut down on the unnecessary duplication of accessories and it might even be annoying in the short term if you have a bunch of accessories that are designed to work around lightning then they might well not work anymore but in the long term I think this is a pretty clear win on for fronts a it's better for the environment cuz from now on any smartphone accessory only needs to be made once and not in two separate versions it's a better customer experience because now you can get away with buying and carrying fewer cables as well as using using whatever charger you want like I can actually feel the relief from the fact that when I now go places I can just take one power brick one cable and that will charge my MacBook my iPhone my Nintendo switch and even any Android whatever I'm carrying at the time this move is also going to reduce some of the forc lockin that people feel with Apple's ecosystem meaning that even if you use an iPhone you won't feel like you have to ditch every single accessory that you bought if you fancy trying an Android and then the final thing is that this is not just any USBC port at least on the pro iPhone this is a USB 3 Port which is not by any means unusual in the industry but it does mean that the transfer speeds are up to 10 GB per second which is a lot better it's like 20 times faster than lightning was what's not clear is if you're going to be able to get that maximum speed with the cable they ship you and also if you're going to be able to fully take advantage of it without using specifically made for iPhone accessories we will find out it's quite funny because as they're announcing this I was just thinking to myself damn now it's just airpods left with a lightning connector and then they announc a set of airpods which also have USBC and I mean that is a pretty big ass to upgrade if you've just bought a lightning pair but it is good news if you've held off so far and then those airpods can be charged by your phone with the same cable that charges your phone which is good to have but it also feels pretty outdated given that most manufacturers can now wirelessly charge their airbuds and then the last big change for these bass iPhones is the Chip And this is both kind of one of the biggest draws and one of the biggest drawbacks see every year up until 2022 when Apple's launched a setup phones all those phones were released with the same chip with potential slight modifications the A14 bionic the a15 bionic Etc but last year they started to separate the pros got the very latest a16 while the normal phones stuck with the same chip as the year before the a15 and so while it is great that the base iPhones this year are getting an upgrade the normal 15s will now get the same a16 that the pros got last year and that it is let's be very clear a super fast chip that will not cause any performance problems what we're not getting is the very latest A7 that the 15 Pros have which basically means yeah this is a trend that we can just expect to see going forward that the pro phones will have not just better materials and better cameras and better display Tech but will also be the only way to actually get the latest internals too remember there's two ways to grow a company you can either increase the amount of customers which I'm sure apple is doing but it's a difficult Market to be doing that in or you can increase the average revenue per customer and I think this is what's happening with the iPhone right now I'm about to show you this in full force but the point is there has never been a bigger gap between Pro and non-pro as there is now with the iPhone 15s and the reason is to make it as much of a no-brainer as possible for a non-pro user to become a pro user because once you become a pro user once if you think about it you're going to stay a pro user you're going to keep buying the ,000 plus phones every time you upgrade and you're probably going to feel more bought into the ecosystem as a result like you might well think well I've already spent a grand on my phone I should probably get airpods Pro and if I get an iPad I should probably get the IP Pro and H what's another $10 a month for some apple music too regardless of the strategy the iPhone 15 Pros are pretty badass and for these there is six major things that we need to talk about the screen is using a brand new better Tech that's allowed Apple to shrink the bezels to basically record-breaking levels to be clear some other phones do have Slimmer side bezels but from everything I've seen I don't think there's a phone that's achieved bezels like this while also having symmetry on all four sides and it's kind of a double win because anytime you manage to shrink the borders around your screen you get a choice you can either make the screen bigger and fit it into the same footprint or you can make your phone smaller with the same screen size which is exactly what Apple's done it's kind of like they've taken last year's iPhone 14 pro and just trimmed off the entire outer layer around the outside the phone is thicker than last generation though presumably to accommodate a bigger battery and so in a way it's actually really important that Apple's managed to do that trimming so that the phone doesn't feel bulky and then you've got the action button a button for which which you can decide what it does which is something it seems like apple tested last year with the more Niche watch Ultra before now rolling out to the mainstream with the iPhone and my heart take is that I like it but I don't love it cuz I mean on one hand for me it's not taking away anything I never really use the ring silence switch cuz when I don't want to be disturbed by notifications I'd rather just go all the way into do not disturb and you can still use this action button to silence your phone but it's just that as well as that you can now also use it to open the camera to start a voice recording or what's really appealing to the hardcore Android customization freak inside of me is that you can also use it to trigger any of your siries shortcuts which basically means any function of your phone so you could use it to open up Spotify you could use it to activate power saving mode which I could actually see myself doing quite a lot well you can even use it to vibrate your speakers at a specific frequency to clear out any water that's got into them my version of a good time but it's just there was also something nice about a slider that you could see what state it was in at a glance and that you can never accidentally trigger like you can with a button plus the key perk of an action button in my mind is that it is a faster more convenient way to trigger a command that you regularly use but when I'm holding my phone and I imagine when you're holding your phone my fingers are never all the way up here to be able to do that comfortably at that point it might actually be easier to just program multiple Taps of your power button to execute that same command I mean that is how I set up my iPhone 14 triple tap on the power button turns the screen grayscale but I do want to live with the action button first before I give any conclusive thoughts on it Apple has swapped materials on the pros from stainless steel to a titanium alloy now this is not the whole phone there's still the ceramic shield on the front and frosted glass on the back but what has changed is this enclosure in between and honestly titanium is great I mean it's even stronger than stainless steel which I mean I have dropped this phone probably six or seven times without a case directly on the floor each time I've had a mini heart attack and every time I've picked it up and been like no way there isn't a single permanent mark on the body so having something that's even stronger than that it's obviously a nice pece of mind but I think the thing that people will largely notice and appreciate more than that is the fact that titanium is also lighter the pro iPhones for a while now have all been on the slightly too weighty for their size side so the reduced density that these bad boys have takes them to that really nice sweet spot where they still feel substantial like any pro phone should but without going so far that it's heavy it also means better thermal conduction out of the phone and we got these curved edges again ever since the day that Apple announced they were switching rounded sides for Sharp flat sides on their phones I've been counting down the days till they go back to having curves I mean it just makes sense your hand is not an angular object so neither should be the single device that you hold in your hand for the longest time so yeah I mean we took our time getting to this stage but boy am I glad we got here this phone feels amazing and it does so while not completely losing the call factor of having some sharpness to the design it's a bit of a shame that they didn't finish this all off with some more exciting unusual colors I mean a deep red wouldn't have hurt anyone but to be fair the silver this time is clean oh yeah there's a camera upgrade obviously there's a camera upgrade smartphones in 2023 so there's a slightly improved Ultra wide camera and a bigger sensor for the main camera which they're saying is going to make up to a two times difference to low light shots so we will definitely test that theory and also subtle little thing they only spent like 3 seconds in the event talking about it but they've also introduced a new coating to the camera which apparently reduces the amount of lens flares this is a top requested feature loads of people have asked for this but equally I don't think it has completely eliminated it based on on my very quick testing 24 megapixels is now the Default Resolution output for the main camera which I know sounds a little underwhelming given that it is a 48 megapixel sensor but what's happened so far and what tends to happen with most companies who use high resolution cameras is that they take the shot at full resolution and then they downscale that resolution to have a cleaner but lower resolution output whereas this kind of makes it seem like apple is now confident enough in the image cleanliness already that they're no longer feeling like they need to reduce that resolution so much obviously Apple's example shots are very curated but they are showing levels of detail that the iPhone 14 in auto mode just could not do and then probably the biggest camera change is on the iPhone 14 pro Max only it's a new telephoto lens it started off as a 2X it then became a 3X and now it is a five time zoom camera five is a lot of zoom and so I imagine the reason that we're not seeing this on the normal size Pro is space limitations and then they're pairing this new lens with better stabilization which is actually really important for higher magnifications because those lenses are much more prone to handshaking cool as it is though I do have some doubts like how there are other phones with 10 times optical zoom cameras which this probably won't outdo plus a big part of what makes Apple's portrait mode so great is that it uses the three time zoom lens so you can sit further away from your subject and you get less distortion on their face but then if your only zoom camera is a five time zoom camera there's probably too much magnification you'll most likely have to leave the room you're standing in to still fit them in the shot and so it seems like what they're going to do instead is to use the main 1X camera and to crop into that which kills the quality a little bit the only way you fix this problem is by having two Zoom cameras you have one high magnification Zoom for when you want to properly get into something and then one much lower magnification one for the portraits last little camera tidbit is that the iPhone 15 Pros are going to be able to take spatial video basically 3D immersive video that you'll be able to properly watch and experience on an Apple Vision Pro headset it's very cool integration it's just not a cheap combo just before we get to pricing we've got to talk about one thing that I am really excited for and that is this a17 Pro chipset because this is the first chip in the world to be based on a 3 nanometer process why is this a big deal well every other top end chip in the world is based on a 4 nanom process and basically the smaller that number the smaller the transistors that make up the chip if the transistors are smaller then they consume less power and you can have more of them and the cool thing about this is that proportionally speaking the jump between the 4 nanm process and the 3 nanm process is actually even bigger than the last maor jump which was between 5 NM and 4 nanm so basically you can expect a 3 NM chip to either run a lot faster if they use the extra space to cram in more transistors or Draw less power and produce less heat if they don't and it seems like based on Apple stats that they're really pushing for the power efficiency angle which based on the iPhone 14s is exactly what I would have wanted them to do there's a pretty decent jump to the graphics power with support for rate tracing and they did show some cool examples of console games that are making the jump to iPhone because of it which I'm all about but then beyond the examples that they showed I find it hard to believe that mass Market Mobile game developers are actually going to get on board anytime soon and May properly R Trace games they also have a new Wi-Fi chip that let the pro phones connect to Wi-Fi 6E which if you have a 6E router is a big jump and a new 5G modem versus last year which should cut the power drain from connecting two mobile networks so yeah while the last iphone 14 series had good battery life it wasn't as good as the iPhone 13 series which really was chart topping but we will test this for ourselves so if you want to see that then a sub to the channel would be energizing then we've got the price this is the first year in a long time where 've had a price bump everything's the same except the pro Max which is now not just $100 more than the pro but 200 you do get more storage but this does put it very squarely up against other companies Ultra phones my first impression is that it probably does do enough to separate itself from the cheaper iPhones but that's what our detail Testa for we'll see you there"
